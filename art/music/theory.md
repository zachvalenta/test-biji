# HARMONY

📙 Levine jazz theory
> melody, lyrics and production are more likely to make a song memorable [than harmony] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d46gO5FUh-g

types
* _harmony_: n notes simultaneously i.e. chords
* harmony even in single note due to overtones https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R67xki4jTwE 5:30

* typical chords named w/ tertian in mind 📙 Harrison rnb [25]

za
* _line cliche_: only mv one chord tone (Bully either way Dylan twist of fate) [Felts 105 Rooksby 184 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCVWHlVNadc] seems equivalent to 'constant structure' [Felts 155] 🗄 oblique motion
* _dominant crescendo_: play V repeatedly while getting louder e.g. Beatles twist and shout Bowie let's dance [Rooksby 26]
* _drone_: note against which movement happens 📙 Harrison rnb 19
* doesn't have to be frozen like a tanpura
* _pedal_: drone played in bass; aka organ point [Harrison rnb 16 Levine 345 Rooksby 191]

beyond triads
* _tension_: 2, 4, 6
* _addition_: triad + tensions [Cowling 10]
* _extension_: seventh + tensions [Levine 35, Felts 30, 67]
* extenion presumed major unless otherwise specified e.g. min9 is min7 + maj 9 [New 28 10:00]
* higher extension presumed to possibly hold lower extension e.g. ∆13 could have 9 or 11 [Cowling 11]
* _alteration_: b5, b9, #9, #11, b13 [Levine 35, 300, 720] typically resolved downwards [Felts 29] hazy definition [Levine 70-71, New 29 9:00]

notation
* chord names via root + quality
* non-root notes named per their scale degrees
* qualities listed in parentheses are optional https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/1s37i2/what_does_a_number_inside_a_parentheses_in_a/cdtfsof
* notate chromatic tensions 📙 Felts 67
* some things are just hard to name e.g. fully-dimished (double sharps/flats) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzSL3MWJiUI 11:20
* altered chords have diff syntax btw jazz (min7 b5) and classical (half diminished) 
* _top-note voicing_: specify top note and leave rest to player 📙 Grudzinski 91
* _composite chord_: non-slash
* aka stack, frame 📙 Kolb 2.12
* more popular than slash 📙 Harrison rnb 14
* _slash chord_: specify inversion via bass note 📙 Wyatt 50, Harrison pop 17, Levine 311
* "built from" = root note of interior chord 📙 Harrison rnb 13-14, 49, Harrson pop 19
* can also have an entire chord under the slash https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDaqkcUKoWs 4:15 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH1M-H-QCjI 🗄 `instruments.md` chord system
* more explicit ("play it this way") but lose explicit function 📙 Cowling 14
* sometimes just the easiest way to explain a convoluted chord 📙 Cowling 14
* jazz tends to highlight chord function 📙 Felts 66
* don't mix sharps and flats e.g. F#/Ab 📙 Cowling 14
* _polychord_: n chords https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiAVQC4tMQU
* used for polytonality https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKaonmghNfg 4:00, 16:00

timing
* _block_: play chord simultaneously https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chord
* also, to play melody in left hand while playing chord https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm_iM31_X3o
* how different than locked hands?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locked_hands_style
* _broken_: play chord non-simultaneously
* _arpeggio_: broken + individual notes

size
* _double stop_: two-note chord
* _dyad_: double stop using chord tones [Harrison 14]
* _triple stop_: three-note chord [Rubin 5] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5jVOnNR6yM
* _triad_: triple stop using chord tones
* _cluster_: >= 3 adjacent scale degrees https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmjRM3AziTY 6:50 triad w/ whole/half at bottom [Harrison rnb 25]

za
* _open_: major/minor unclear e.g. suspended
* _suspended_: non-tertian; open; can't tell what chord it is when inverted [New 5:45, 8:40, Harrison rnb 9, Davis 18]
* _hybrid_: no thirds, root not repeated in higher register [Felts 56, 146]

other types
* _out_: purposefully playing outside functional harmony [Levine 183] how to (sequences, play half step or tritone away)
* in metal, Slayer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7omfdRzESE
* _nonfunctional_: not a model, just anything that's not functional https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dghtjke4X7I 1:45
* _transformational_: relationships defined by harmonic closeness btw chords, not btw chord and key center; aka Neo-Riemannian https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dghtjke4X7I 2:10

functions and modes
* makes the most sense for major scale
* Ionian/Aeolian as primary modes bc their harmonization is smoothest (no tritones w/ other scale degrees) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW6YeDJklhQ 5:10
* "typically don't base harmony off modes" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0RThBK4nTU 0:55
* dominant-esque chords of mode will have characteristic pitch

tonal vs. modal, functionl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCkCn0dEgpw
* dominant chord typically resolves down a fifth e.g. C7 to F https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRyzb68wV7U 2:00
* vocal https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFqubZ7it3A

* _tonal_: based around tonic [Wyatt 10]
* _atonal_: not based around tonic
* _tonal_: has key center, scale degrees have functions
* fine to use something chromatic if the voice leading is good https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1nG1Rj3jWM 8:00
* even stuff that's chromatic can be anchored by diatonic surroundings https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NckkwiYrjTw 4:50
* 5-1 but use diminished instead https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdPvr2jPcl0 7:45

* _functional harmony_: different chords have different roles https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djqSL5b-pWk 2:35 tonic, outgoing, medial, incoming https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvyChMVvqnQ
* _functional harmony_: tonic, dominant, subdominant; typically thought of in terms of Ionian and Aeolian i.e. dominant isn't dominant in Dorian https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0RThBK4nTU https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(music) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1nG1Rj3jWM 5:30 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkMl0dWN8ZU 10:00 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rEqrPwVITY 5:45 https://flypaper.soundfly.com/write/where-have-all-the-v-chords-gone-the-decline-of-functional-harmony-in-pop

* B section aka bridge [Davis 8]
* length can refer to section or song e.g. Night in Tunisia (AABA C solos AABA * 2) [Gioia 64]

> "If you put chord changes in front of [Chet], it didn't mean anything to him. He would say in a self-deprecating way, 'Well I don't know the chord changes to the song.' . . . We would go and sit in with bands, often playing until five in the morning, and any of the songs they would play, Chet knew. But he would ask a question that would puzzle the other players. 'What's my starting note?' he'd ask. They thought he was putting them on or something, but all he wanted was the first note on the trumpet so he would know where to start the piece. From there he could navigate any song by ear. Sometimes the other players would try to fool him. They might try to trick him by playing 'All the Things You Are' in E or 'Body and Soul' in B rather than D flat. But Chet would have no problems with doing that. It was the other musicians who ended up struggling—they had tried to give Chet problems, but they just caught up themselves." http://web.archive.org/web/20160408040539/http://www.jazz.com/jazz-blog/2008/5/12/could-chet-baker-play-jazz
