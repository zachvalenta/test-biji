## criticism

* MBV
> What took so long for Shields to find in the studio was the ecstatic pleasure point buried in the suffocating psychic evisceration caused by pure unadulterated volume. On most rock records, the music drowns out the lyrics; on Loveless, the music drowns out the music. The songs are packed dense with multi-track vocals, distortion, tremolo guitar licks, drum loops, mechanical squeaks from robot zoo animals, the sweet moans of clouds mating, and other sound bites from a terrifyingly beautiful rapture. On many tracks, it’s as if the actual song that you assume is in the middle of all of this has been removed, and it’s just sonic detritus floating along in suspended animation, doing lovely little pirouettes and blowing peyote smoke rings. http://grantland.com/features/why-my-bloody-valentine-loveless-greatest-rock-album-our-greatness-averse-age/
* Radiohead
> I think Radiohead has everything going for them except their music. Radiohead initially came to my attention after they sampled Paul Lansky’s "mild und leise" (an excellent early computer music composition, available on Lansky’s website) for their song Idioteque. Paul likes what they did with his sample much more than I do. I find the drum track weak in comparison with DnB practice which was so much further along by the late 90s, and the voice is plaintive, thin, lacking all conviction. Radiohead looks good on paper, a fusion of modern techno-derived computer music techniques with rock music, but in practice, the tunes are uninteresting, and the sound production is unexceptional. Another one of many post-MBV disappointments that understand the ideas but not the spirit of My Bloody Valentine. I don’t enjoy criticizing Radiohead because they clearly mean well, and their music is carefully and thoughtfully assembled. But they just don’t deliver brilliant musical goods, and I’m somewhat puzzled by their mass success. But I am pleased by it. It’s nice to see rock intellectuals getting serious attention. And their recent Internet marketing experiments deserve attention, just for trying something different. But I’d take the Pale Saints’ fully realized "The Comforts of Madness" over any Radiohead album, by a very large margin. https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/10/eric-lyon-on-ra.html

> But Reynolds hates the talented ones most--when schemers like the Housemartins or the Pet Shop Boys actually top the charts, his sarcasm is scathing. He can't stand mature pop, pop as theory--pop should be crazes, fantasies, slavish devotion, antisocial noise, the grain of the voice, pretty boys frittering away their stipends while crooked managers conceal ill-gotten gains in Bahamian bank accounts. He opposes naturalism, logocentrism, journalism, "the merry street dance of egalitarianism," "off-the-peg self-improvement." He defends Morrissey's self-pity and doesn't bat an eye when Kristin Hersh allows as how she never liked having a body or My Bloody Valentine boast that only two of their songs mention suicide. He'll take id over ego, ego over superego, mad romance over "love as contract." He valorizes Roland Barthes's "`voluptuous infantilism' of languor," Nick Cave's neomedieval passivity in the face of horrible fate. He wants "vastness," "re-mystification," "the vertigo of rapture." He wants adolescent solipsism, psychedelic schizophrenia, an underground that never gets on the telly. He wants vision. He wants excess. If you find these values limited or illusory, bully for you. Occasionally so does Reynolds, who at one point admits he votes Labour. https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rock/reynolds-90.php

post-60s [Gioia 225]
> cadential motion is out, Herbie Hancock and LA won, disco and rnb mattered more to jazz in past 50 years than bebop or even hard bop [me to Tom 2021.01.06]
* That Chaka Khan song 'the memory lingers on' came on today and I laughed. Jazz has existed in the past tense FOR 50 YEARS! Per Miles Davis wiki: "Jazz is dead... it's finito!"
* _third stream_: jazz + classical; ECM https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECM_Records [Gioia 146, Ross listen to this 219]
* _Americana_: Frisell
* _pomo_: Zorn [Gioia 151]

definition of jazz
* repetition w/out stagnation via improvisation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxyJwJBjCRM
* suppose that third-stream would challenge this
* inveterately 'hot' [Gioia 39]

> Yeah, exactly. Just that whole concept, the history, the evolution. You've got musicians that are known for bebop but if you look at the cabaret laws that were introduced, there's a reason why it went from big band to bebop. It was all about money, really. If you didn't have a bigger band and people dancing, then you didn't have to pay certain taxes, so the music developed that way, but as a result you lost that dance culture. - https://reverb.com/news/interview-moses-boyd-on-londons-jazz-diaspora

Others are welcome. Lately, we have been consistently 3- guitar/banjo, guitar/fiddle/banjo, and bass/tuba. An occasional extra guitar or 3 have been showing up. Just think about any 3 tunes you know well enough to sing or teach and come by...

* labels also used 3rd party distribution https://secretlydistribution.com/

publishing
* used to be finding artist for song (aka plugging, professional/active)
* post-Beatles, artists create own publishing company and outsource admin to PaaS
* rap and country still have traditional publishing functions
* _administration_: register copyright, collecting royalties
* _work for hire_: writer retains no ownership, not acknowledged as creator
* _songwriting_: 9-5 songwriter, paid salary or royalties

personae
* _agent_: books shows, can do yourself, don't want to work with you until you're successful, they take percentage of show, don't pay them any other way
* _A&R_: manage artists, find music for them to play http://songexploder.net/ghostface-killah https://www.musicxray.com/ https://web.archive.org/web/20070928182458/http://www.negativland.com/albini.html

* _licensing_: get music into tv/film
* _manager_: emails
* _promoter_: advertises live shows; venues don't do promotion
* _publicist_: marketing http://blog.sonicbids.com/ask-a-publicist-what-do-you-do-exactly https://www.emptycountry.com/ payola https://www.instagram.com/musiciansshowcase/

label
* _netlabel_: free online distribution, artist retains copyright
* labels used to exist for distribution, but now for promotion and connections (production, other artists) https://www.thebalancecareers.com/review-of-cd-baby-online-music-distributor-2460989
> I don’t get an advance from my label unfortunately, they strictly distribute and promote, everything I do is out of pocket. (shows, studio time) https://nashville.craigslist.org/muc/d/nashville-bassist-needed/7301931636.html

* indie: XL, True Panther Sounds (Girls, Slowthai)
* large: Universal, Sony, Warner Bros
* BYO: using bandcamp for distribution https://www.whateversclever.club/
* sample labels: can't create samples from preexisting work on Splice or other packages like Native Instruments https://splice.com/blog/how-to-start-sample-label/
* money: labels get a cut of touring
> From my understanding they get a percent of merch for sure. But then also with 360 deals they take a much larger cut. Plus often have booking person as part of label for bigger cut. But on a % basis not sure - Allison

charts
* top 40 was made, not observed https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24405427 share of listening to hits in decline https://qz.com/1899097/is-spotify-killing-the-top-40/
* https://www.matthewball.vc/all/audiotech
* Derek Thompson
> afaik charts (top 40, hot 100, etc.) are closer to listicles than empiricism, so it might turn out that Spotify/YT/Apple is the first occasion we actually know what people listen to at all.
* physical units count more than streams (solution on how to estimate listens for physical purchases is non-obvious to me, esp. re: disparities among demographics, genres)
> Because a sale [of physical unit] counts for more in chart math than a stream, those albums that do manage to rack up sales generally dominate the chart - https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/dj-khaled-vs-billboard-explained.html 
> all this makes the tussling btw scott/nicki and khaled/tyler more superficial: their point of contention has never been more prestige-based or less tied to financial remuneration. line up for your youth soccer trophy, everyone can have a #1! but the difference for musicians is that: charts -> buzz -> awards -> more buzz -> more money. so perhaps less directly tied to money than previously so but still a strong financial aspect.
* audio format influence on composition https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnfTaqGFW8M song length (going down) songs per album (going up) how soon the chorus comes in (sooner); I found this nuanced, esp. mentions the phenomenon is nothing new (the phonograph changed song length and instrument choice as well); David Byrne (of the Talking Heads) has a musicology book where he discusses these topics further, like how the room acoustics of CBGB and the audience's drinking/talking/shouting influenced bands to play music that was loud and direct (punk) whereas the size of opera halls has increased over the past couple hundred years and music adapted to utilize the bigger reverb of those venues. Also, this video marks the second time I've heard of 'tropical house' and the fact that it's associated with deep house and a true musical mind like Larry Heard makes me realize yet again that there is no justice in this life. Also new to me is the term 'lean-back listening', which seems like a synonym for 'self-selected muzak'.

https://www.matthewball.vc/all/audiotech
> To support engagement-based monetization, Spotify and its label suppliers had to define engagement. And they chose to do this on a per stream basis with a minimum stream time of 30 seconds (to avoid accidental plays, track skipping, etc.). However, this meant that a 10-minute track, five-minute track and 31-second track generated the same royalties.
> Notably, labels are also encouraging artists to simplify the name of their songs and albums in order to ensure they’re optimized for voice-controlled speakers and touchscreen-based searches. A track with five words is more likely to be misunderstood or suffer from autocorrect than one with two. Similarly, voice assistants are known to struggle with accents, such as Irish or even Texan. Being hard to say means you might not get played.
> Between 1954 and 1962, 5.5 million transistor radios were sold in the United States. In 1963 this install base nearly doubled to 10 million, many of which were received as Christmas gifts. The top use case (or “killer app”) for this newly ubiquitous device? Listening to the Beatles’ I Want to Hold Your Hand, which was coincidentally released for radio play on December 26th.
* transistor radio enabled private listening, which is what we're still living with
>  For example, terrestrial broadcast radio pays fixed per-play rates, regardless of the number of listeners, and only a song’s writers are compensated, not the performers. On-demand streaming pays per listen and all talent is compensated. In addition, these services pay on a fixed share of revenue basis, which means talent’s revenues grow linearly with that of distributors.
> In addition, sporting events typically support a full 360 degrees on stadium seating, while concerts afford only 150 (no one wants to stare at the back of a screen).
> Concerts also fit a relatively narrow range of attendee personalities/behaviors than live sports. The only way a Kanye fan can sit and enjoy the live concert is if they’re rich enough to afford a box. This means many would-be concert goers can support their favourite artists only by downloading their album or streaming them more on Spotify. Sports fans also benefit dozens of opportunities to see their favourite team in person each year. Music fans, meanwhile, have only a few, if any, chances to see their favourite artists.
> For similar reasons, artists with only 5,000 fans globally can finally monetize their live performances even if not one fan lives within 100 miles of another.

> Then there’s the enormity of Travis’ Scott’s Fortnite concert. Nearly 30 million people spent nine minutes fully immersed in his music. This included die-hard and casual fans, non-fans and people who didn’t even know he existed. There is no other experience on earth — including the Super Bowl half-time show — that can deliver this degree of reach and attention, COVID-19 or not. The track Scott premiered during the concert (The Scotts, a collaboration with Kid Cudi) debuted at #1 on Billboard a week later. This was Cudi’s first Billboard #1 and the biggest debut of 2020. In addition, several of the tracks Scott performed from his two-year-old Astroworld album returned to the Billboard charts. And many millions of dollars of virtual Scott goods were sold. https://www.matthewball.vc/all/what-is-an-entertainment-company-and-why-does-the-answer-matter

more live
> A pet theory of mine: most revenue in music comes from either live or extra-musical (Rihanna and Fenty, Moby and car commercials). Live + popular genre (i.e. not jazz/blues/folk) = you will make some money. Rap has always struggled here. Listen to the local rap station; when they have an arena show, they need 17 artists to move all the tickets; the same situation for even less popular genres (rock, rnb) would be unthinkable. Live music has a bias towards instruments. - to Ellen, WhatsApp 21.11.02
> That's the dichotomy: it's the most popular genre by far but severely underperforms live. If you made a list of top 100 rappers, #50-100 seem lucky to sell out 2-3k venues; to sell out MSG, you need to be either #1-5 or combine 2-3 from #10-30. Feels like #50-100 bluegrass or classical artists could sell out a 2-3k venue, no? The intuitive conclusion is that instruments make a big deal in something feeling live. Rap live is more akin to watching a football game on tape delay; something is missing.

> So the most important thing a community site can do is attract the kind of people it wants. A site trying to be as big as possible wants to attract everyone. But a site aiming at a particular subset of users has to attract just those—and just as importantly, repel everyone else. I've made a conscious effort to do this on HN. The graphic design is as plain as possible, and the site rules discourage dramatic link titles.

> When poets give public readings, they should spend part of every program reciting other people's work—preferably poems they admire by writers they do not know personally. Readings should be celebrations of poetry in general, not merely of the featured author's work.
> When arts administrators plan public readings, they should avoid the standard subculture format of poetry only. Mix poetry with the other arts, especially music. Plan evenings honoring dead or foreign writers. Combine short critical lectures with poetry performances. Such combinations would attract an audience from beyond the poetry world without compromising quality.
> Poets need to write prose about poetry more often, more candidly, and more effectively. Poets must recapture the attention of the broader intellectual community by writing for nonspecialist publications. They must also avoid the jargon of contemporary academic criticism and write in a public idiom. Finally, poets must regain the reader's trust by candidly admitting what they don't like as well as promoting what they like. Professional courtesy has no place in literary journalism.
> . Poets who compile anthologies—or even reading lists—should be scrupulously honest in including only poems they genuinely admire. Anthologies are poetry's gateway to the general culture. They should not be used as pork barrels for the creative-writing trade. An art expands its audience by presenting masterpieces, not mediocrity. Anthologies should be compiled to move, delight, and instruct readers, not to flatter the writing teachers who assign books. Poet-anthologists must never trade the Muse's property for professional favors.
> Poetry teachers especially at the high school and undergraduate levels, should spend less time on analysis and more on performance. Poetry needs to be liberated from literary criticism. Poems should be memorized, recited, and performed. The sheer joy of the art must be emphasized. The pleasure of performance is what first attracts children to poetry, the sensual excitement of speaking and hearing the words of the poem. Performance was also the teaching technique that kept poetry vital for centuries. Maybe it also holds the key to poetry's future.
