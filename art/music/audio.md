2020
* _autumn_: rf mobile workstation
* _summer_: interface (buy, setup, record guitar direct-in), mic/stand, recording taxnomy (initial research for mobile workstation, try out Koala)
* _spring_: Song Exploder, figure out that Ableton is the thing I need for looping live, research reamp/preamp/DI
* _winter_: record sample MIDI tracks in Abletone, research live setup and DAW-less (Digitakt, Korg Volca)

* _19_: week at home = realize break from work fastest way to instill habits, London = little material progress but instill habits, Ableton (chop to rack)
* _18_: read some of Ableton manual

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q77ZIF-Nno
* _overhead_: farther away; aka ambient [Franz 91]
* _close miking_: mic close but not on instrument [Franz 91]
* _contact_: on the actual thing (drum, violin) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Oq6gPkihmk 1:40
* diretion matters e.g. point hi-hat mic away from snare [Franz 73]
* don't put mic too close to amp, will only pick up bass frequencies https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cqdOEntvkE 4:00
* put mics 10/20 feet away and see what you get https://reverb.com/news/next-step-home-studio-moves-5-ways-to-improve-your-tracking-and-mixing
* vocals: mic at angle to reduce pops [Peckham 46] 6 inces to 2 feet away [Franz 101] 2 inches away pointing down [ibid 102] back away from mic for louder parts [ibid] for group vocals no more than 2 mics due to phasing [ibid 103]
* _proximity effect_: close miking can capture too much bass frequency [Franz 101]

## theory

components
* _microphone_: translates sound and generates electrical signal to represent [Downey 1.1] capture detail to pass along to preamp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5ymvnffkz0 4:15
* _diaphragm_: part of mic metal plate that moves in response to air pressure and generates signal to represent sound [Franz 34, 101]
* _speaker_: translates electrical signal back to sound [Downey 1.1]

misc
* _mono_: same signal sent to both speakers https://blog.discogs.com/en/mono-versus-stereo/
* _stereo_: different signal to different speakers https://music.stackexchange.com/a/24635/56021
* _stereo image_: illusion of space [Franz 105] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy

polar patterns
* which direction will pick up signal
* some mics can switch [Franz 75]
* bass frequencies (<= 150 Hz) are omnidirectional i.e. we can't tell where they're coming from i.e. no stereo image [Franz 105]
* _cardioid_: one direction [Franz 74]
* _bidirectional_: 180° [Franz 74]
* _omnidirection_: 360• [Franz 74]

frequencies
* _frequency response_: range of frequencies picked up by mic e.g. sm-57 picks up mids, beta-52 bass [Franz 75] re: monitors/headphones, what frequencies are boosted [Franz 182]
* _bass rolloff_: reduce bass frequencies [Franz 75]
* _bass cutoff_: rm bass frequencies [Franz 75]

power
* _phantom power_: 48V [Franz 75]
* _pad switch_: attenuates incoming signal to prevent mic damage [Franz 76]
* _active_: needs phantom power
* _passive_: doesn't need phantom power
* _dynamic_: passive; less flat frequency response [Franz 101] used more live https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rt8E7WGvdiA 1:30 used more for close miking [Franz 91]
* _condenser_: active; flat frequency response = used more for vocals [Franz 101] used more in studio https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rt8E7WGvdiA 2:45 used more for overhead miking [Franz 91] turn on/off phantom before plug/unplug mic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cqdOEntvkE 3:15
* _ribbon_: passive but will be damaged if given phantom [Franz 75]
> For ribbon-mic-style background vocals without a ribbon mic, try using whatever vocal mic you already own, but use an EQ to mimic the frequency response of a vintage ribbon: add a bit of a bump to the low-mids and roll-off the highs. https://reverb.com/news/how-to-get-the-nashville-sound-in-your-home-studio
* _USB_: doesn't need audio interface

Back in 2014 I was working hard to improve my live drum recordings against all odds. I wanted to make jazz funk in the style of my favourite UK band Atmosfear (formed in '78). I was inspired by (and could easily relate to) their quite good but noticeably not that good chops. I heard that the drummer, Ray Johnson, had only been playing for a year or so before the band was formed and it shows in both the wavering tempo and enthusiastic hi-hat/snare work. As a starting point it felt more approachable than some of the more polished and technically accomplished American Jazz Funk that Atmosfear were surely inspired by.

I had a Shure SM57 microphone and an Akai MG614 four track tape recorder. The drum kit was stitched together over the years, mostly pieces that had been abandoned at different East side jam spaces I'd rented over the years. I had recently bought a beautiful 1973 Fender Rhodes Stage piano which I played through a Roland JC-120 amplifier. It sounded great!

So where to begin? Well I recorded the drums first. It took a while to get the sound I wanted and honestly I didn't even come close to achieving it but the groove was simple and it sounded alright. Onwards! I over dubbed some percussions (congas, cowbell etc), followed by a simple chord progression on the keyboard. Hmm...how about a bassline? This came quickly on Liam's black Fender Musicmaster with the flatwound strings. It's a shortscale bass so there are lots of dead spots but if you play right in the middle of the neck it can really sit nicely in a mix. The lyrics didn't take too long and I'm pretty sure nothing was written down. Some people think it's a sample but that's my voice, just jamming. Maybe you recognise it from some of my other music? You'll certainly hear more of it in my upcoming releases.

Once all the parts were in place I ran the tracks through the studio Akai MG1214 with a Roland Space Echo on the send. After about 50 real time passes I finally got the mixdown and effects/fade performance I wanted. In the process I made a few interesting versions and that's what is included here on this release. A drum/bass focused dub mix that slowly unfolds into the full keys/vocal/bass/drums that we all know plus a nice long ambient outro for the DJs.

Since you've read this far I'll just quickly touch on the production of Atmosphere. The process was more or less the same except for that for this one I dragged out the old upright piano that lives at our studio. Again, just some simple chords and a fun melody was all I was looking for here. The long introduction includes a field recording I had made one rainy evening of cars driving through the wet Chinatown streets.

Anyway, thanks for letting me share the story of how I made this music. I noticed that many people categorise Thirstin' and Atmosphere as "House Music" so I just wanted to give a little background of the production, the intention and the spirit behind these songs.

> Not that Dylan is capable of putting out product in the manner of a Major Rock Professional. He has always resisted that. It has been his practice to just go into the studio and cut, so that a lot of what gets onto the LP you buy in the store is first and second takes. Chuck Berry and the early Beatles were recorded this way, but over the past decade it has become customary (if not compulsory) to put more quality control into the manufacture of rock and roll, and Blood on the Tracks sounds as if it consents to what is best about such standards. It has pace, flow, variety; it tolerates few if any gaffes; it is well made...Dylan's alacrity in the studio hardly commits him to spontaneity, especially to spontaneity as it is commonly understood--the free play of the undefended self and so forth. On the contrary, Dylan is always guarded--he knows almost exactly what will happen when he records. Each release is intended to objectify a preordained concept that is both quickened and preserved for posterity by his instant studio technique. Particularly since Blonde on Blonde, the vehicle of each concept has been a voice that in some way exemplifies it, the most extreme example being the high lonesome tenor of Nashville Skyline. https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rock/dylan-75.php

> The production value of the "Back at One" bass [McKnight] is as close to Celine Dion's as anything else—a straightforward playing of a full-frequencied roundwound electric.

* saturated
> Sly & The Family Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On—with its fuzzy, overdubbed-to-near-oblivion tape saturation
* from the subconscious
> The bass of Sly's "Family Affair," while plenty muted and thumping, still has some quack to it. Voodoo seems to have a low-pass filter reining in all such highs, the treble rolled back to the point where there's little articulation at all. The basslines on Voodoo tracks like "Left and Right" and "The Line" seem to pop out of nowhere. It's almost like you're listening through a wall.
> vintage Precision Basses (Pino had both a '61 and a '63)...those basses were strung with heavy-gauge La Bella flatwounds, tuned down to D (DGCF) or even a half-step lower, and played mostly through an Ampeg B-15 (or a B-18 when not). The amp was recorded with a Neumann U 47 FET, tube U 47, or M 49, into an AMS Neve 1081 mic-pre, and treated with an LA-2A compressor

# SIGNAL FLOW

routing [Franz 121]
* _bus_: sends n signals
* _send_: route, esp. from bus
* _aux_: destination of bus
* _return_: output of aux

* _preamp_:

## DI

* _DI_: routing to recorder/headphones/board; aka direct box
* some have preamp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cqdOEntvkE 5:15 https://reverb.com/p/mxr-bass-di-plus https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cqdOEntvkE 5:15
* route to both amp and soundboard https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4EZQDTdfxo 2:30 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th-zFTHnYvQ 3:20
* reduces ground lift https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cqdOEntvkE 5:15
* routing comes in handy for reamp (add fx later) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fwnj5n1SdxY 1:40 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luE_WcCZkOw

* _Radial jdi_: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cqdOEntvkE 5:00 EHX battalion

## line levels

* _mic_: amplify to line level for recording https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDWl3U7pGQk 0:30
* _instrument_: from bass/guitar; bit higher than mic https://www.sweetwater.com/sweetcare/articles/whats-the-difference-between-mic-instrument-line-and-speaker-level-signals/
* _line_: level at which things can be recorded, what a preamp outputs
* _speaker_: signal output after amplification, highest in voltage

misc
* compatability: pro gear uses +4 dBm (plus four) and home recording uses -10 dBV (minus ten) [Franz 12]
* can use reference signal to gauge signal flow through entire setup [Franz 82]

## patch

semantics
* _print_: add effect before signal hits recording device [Franz 118]
* _insert_: an effect that you print [Franz 122, 184] typically compression, EQ [ibid 126]
* _patch_: 动 route output to another input [Franz 119] 名 place in signal flow where you can patch; aka insert https://www.sweetwater.com/insync/insert/
* _patchbay_: hardware that does patching [Franz 19-22] https://reverb.com/news/a-closer-look-at-patchbays https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ie8J_XjOaFw

approaches
* _serial_: route signal in order (as opposed to fx loop) e.g. mic, preamp, compressor, recording device [Franz 119]
* _fx loop_: route signal from device (amp, mixer) to effect and then route back [Franz 119] in amps, comes btw preamp and power amp so you can put modulation/time pedals after distortion from amp (pedal platform amps don't need bc don't add amp distortion) https://blog.andertons.co.uk/learn/should-i-use-a-guitar-amp-effects-loop https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZphkKEsie4 5:45

* stop hum: EHX hum debugger https://reverb.com/news/common-home-recording-stumbling-blocks-and-how-to-avoid-them get amp off floor [Franz 97]
* couldn't put pedals btw amp and speaker bc current would fry them https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_fhp41X2yM 5:15

## amplification

🗄 `guitar.md` amplification
🗄 `science.md` sound

* _amplify_: increase amplitude [Franz 191]
* _attenuate_: decrease amplitude https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Be1e0QPIPK0 1:35
* _attenutor_: device that weakens signal; could be simple as volume knob [Franz 14]; overdrive amp to get tone, then use attenuator to weaken signal to reduce volume https://reverb.com/guide/buying-guide-attenuators
* _hi-z_: aka high impedance (vs. lo-z) [Franz 12] boosts signal; w/out you'll have to turn volume way up on guitar which will lead to overdrive https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBv3OK5ASgQ 4:20 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY3C2hWKE9U
* _impedence_: https://www.jefftk.com/p/does-impedance-matter
* _ground lift_: reduce background hiss/hum
* _true bypass_: doesn't go through circuit if turned off https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtdCLYft_Z8 3:15
* _bypass_: goes through circuit without applying effect; maintains timing if doubling signal on which effect is being applied [Franz 204]
* _wattage_: how many watts speaker can handle before clipping https://blog.andertons.co.uk/learn/voltage-wattage-ohms
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JAzuBAWqzc&list=PLIiejGE6XOglA5KvSD9w7GLPsZtq74V2n&index=35
* 4:1 ratio in wattage btw bass and guitar amps https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oVqytXgSFI 14:00
* _feedback_: recursively signal passing btw speakers and mic [Franz 115] recursion in geneal [Cowen stubborn attachments 30]
> In general, the more you pay for a speaker, the louder it will be. 12” speaker is usually rated at 94 dB. mid-priced speaker might be 97, that’s double the volume each step. https://blog.andertons.co.uk/learn/wattage-vs-volume
> The same goes with amps – A 100W amp is only twice as loud as a 10W amp. And a 1000W amp is twice as loud as 100W. This might put the cost of high wattage amps into some perspective. https://blog.andertons.co.uk/learn/wattage-vs-volume

gain
* _gain_: how much signal being amplified [Franz 190] https://music.stackexchange.com/a/54039 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain_%28electronics%29
* increases volume (hence why used as synonym for volume) https://music.stackexchange.com/a/90121
* sounds really bad in digital form [Franz 42]
* _distortion_: sound of amp reaching volume limit [Franz 14] aka tape saturation [ibid 42]
* _unity gain_: output signal same as input signal https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVXUPu8980o 
* _gain stage_: device that amplifies (or, confusingly, attenuates) signal e.g. preamp, amp, attentuator [Franz 14]
* maintain good levels by spread out gain adjustments among gain stages
* _boost_: gain in a small enough dose that increases volume while not causing much distortion https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTwKQ4w9cdY boost pedals sometimes known as boost preamps (cf. preamp gain) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Evm2mvQSRH4 1:40

clipping
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp2o_CzG8TA
* _clipping_: amplify signal beyond amps ability to handle which caps waveforms https://music.stackexchange.com/a/90154
* _distortion_: sound of clipping
* _soft clipping_: waveform rounded; sounds nicer, happens in tube amps
* _hard clipping_: waveform flattened; sounds harsh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwqD601DTz8 4:15
* _headroom_: diff btw optimum input and maximum input (when you get clipping) [Franz 12] higher wattage = more headroom = high volume before clipping https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRbdseOJCT4 3:55 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG8pbLudqoU 8:45
> point being that more headroom = warm 70s-style distortion vs. harsh metal distortion? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex4gug2r2ec 6:00
