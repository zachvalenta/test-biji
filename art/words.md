group think
* _au courant_: keeping up with the Jones

> But Boulez cannot hear past his knee-jerk aversion to anything resembling functional tonality in the work of a twentieth-century composer. In the spirit of experimentation, Stravinsky was willing to run the risk of sounding innocent or even sentimental—a risk Boulez would never have admitted to his oeuvre’s steel fortress. This reductive attitude, this refusal to listen past Stravinsky’s surfaces and meet the music on its own terms, is a harbinger of the bullying narrow-mindedness that Boulez brings to his analyses of more recent music. - https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2020/11/05/pierre-boulez-sound-and-fury/

That’s Stancil. https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/the-good-white-man-roster

If Fukuyama and his neoconservative allies believed the world was yearning to be remade on an imaginary American model, the woke movement believes "whiteness" accounts for all the evils of modern societies. America’s record of slavery and racism is all too real. Even so, passing over in silence the repression and enslavement of peoples outside the West - Tibetans, Uighurs and now Mongols in China, for example - because they cannot be condemned as crimes of white supremacy reveals a wilfully parochial and self-absorbed outlook. - John Gray https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2020/10/american-unreality

* _lacuna_: gap in knowledge, unaccounted for edge cases
> And the program still has some weird lacunae that leave out certain categories of state and local government workers, and doesn’t really meet the needs of the very elderly in an aging society. https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-cares-superdole-was-a-huge-success

* _natter_: talk of unimportant things
* _procrustean_: overly rigid/uniform 📙 Taleb

* _intemperate_: lacking self-control
* _irascible_: hot-tempered 
> The tone of The Deep Places is consistently and understandably somber, but Douthat’s prose is most effective when he becomes crabby; there is an irascible spirit hiding beneath the surface here that I find quite endearing. https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/review-ross-douthats-the-deep-places

> Jagger's distance from the Afro part of his Afro-American musical heritage was especially liberating for white Americans. Whereas for Elvis and those natives who followed him the blues bore an inescapable load of racial envy and fear, Mick's involvement was primarily aesthetic. Since as his English blues preceptor, Alexis Korner, once remarked, Jagger's chief worry was whether the music was "performed properly," he betrayed no embarrassment about being white. Not all Englishmen were so uninhibited--an obsessive like Eric Burdon (of the Animals) emulated black Southern intonations sedulously. But Jagger got off on being a white person singing black songs, and he put that across. His mocking, extravagant elocution, as wild as his hair and the way he pranced around the stage, was more than vaguely self-amused, achieving a power that compared to that of its origins because it was true to itself. https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/music/stones-76.php
