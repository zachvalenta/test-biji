how > what
> I am fond of saying that a movie is not about what it's about; it's about how it's about it. - Ebert on 'The Departed'
> I think all writing is experimental. The very obvious sort of experimental writing is not really more experimental that that of a conventional write like myself. I experiment all the time but the experiments are hidden. Rather like abstract art: you look at an abstract picture, and then you look at a close-up of a Renaissance painting and find the same abstactions. 📙 Paris Review chapbook qt. William Trevor [286]

anti-patterns
* grafting story onto non-story forms (song cycles, concept albums) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillaz
* seeking prestige
* arranging placards around their work explaining its background and meaning http://www.thrilljockey.com/artists/koen-holtkamp
* listing titles ("writer, essayist, poet")
* swinging too much with or against the times (post-Clash, Americana)
> The Getty tells us that the past was perhaps different from the way we like to perceive it. Ancient marbles were not always attractively faded and worn. Ancient marbles once appeared just as they appear here: as strident, opulent evidence of imperial power and acquisition. Ancient murals were not always bleached and mellowed and 'tasteful'. Ancient murals once looked as they do there: as if dreamed by a Mafia don. Ancient fountains once worked, and drowned out that very silence we have come to expect and want from the past. 📙 Didion 112
* context-dependent
> Whenever I see a painting impressively hung in a museum, I ask myself: how much would I pay for this if I found it at a garage sale, dirty and frameless, and with no idea who painted it? If you walk around a museum trying this experiment, you'll find you get some truly startling results. http://paulgraham.com/copy.html
* lacking rigor
> Art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the painting department. The textile department, which my next door neighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt illustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous. Painting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the more worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive signature style. A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business is known as a "schtick": something that immediately identifies the work as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy Lichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in the apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions of dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature style, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work. http://paulgraham.com/worked.html

* one-person projects and Noah Webster https://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary
> In 1807, he started writing a dictionary, which he called, boldly, An American Dictionary of the English Language. He wanted it to be comprehensive, authoritative. Think of that: a man sits down, aiming to capture his language whole. Dictionaries today are not written this way. In fact it’d be strange even to say that they’re written. They are built by a large team, less a work of art than of engineering... Webster’s dictionary took him 26 years to finish. It ended up having 70,000 words. He wrote it all himself, including the etymologies, which required that he learn 28 languages, including Old English, Gothic, German, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Welsh, Russian, Aramaic, Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit. He was plagued by debt to fund the project; he had to mortgage his home.

> Some players maybe had equal or even inferior results to mine (I had a good work ethic and took no drugs), but it was obvious they were greater talents at analysis. Top chess players who worked with Bobby Fischer also attest that in this regard he was tops, not just "another great player." That was true even before he was good enough and steady enough to become world champion. When talking ideas with people, the same issue surfaces - just how quickly and how imaginatively do they grasp what is going on?
> Take a person’s favorite genres of art, music, whatever. But something outside of their work lives. Maybe it can even be sports. How deeply do they understand the said subject matter? At what kind of level can they talk about it or enjoy it or maybe even practice it? Remember in Hamlet, how Hamlet puts on a play right before the King’s eyes, to see how the King reacts to “art”? Here we are testing for sensibility more than any kind of rigorous analysis, though the analysis test may kick in as well. Just how deep is the person’s deepest sensibility?
* change in econ changes culture
> People generate culture and community in any material condition you put them in and therefore experience some kind of loss when that material condition changes, even for the better. Put more provocatively: all material progress, even just progress related to the distribution of income, destroys culture. This fact creates some irresolvable tensions on the left. Suffering, deprivation, and oppression generate unique identities, culture, and communities that will be dramatically changed, if not eradicated, by leftist campaigns to alleviate suffering, deprivation, and oppression. The radical material reordering of society is also indirectly a cultural genocide. https://mattbruenig.com/2021/05/12/what-is-lost-in-post-scarcity/

> when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason - Keats https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_capability0
* government funding
> Imagine, for example, what would happen if the government decided to commission someone to write an official Great American Novel. First there'd be a huge ideological squabble over who to choose. Most of the best writers would be excluded for having offended one side or the other. Of the remainder, the smart ones would refuse such a job, leaving only a few with the wrong sort of ambition. The committee would choose one at the height of his career — that is, someone whose best work was behind him — and hand over the project with copious free advice about how the book should show in positive terms the strength and diversity of the American people, etc, etc. The unfortunate writer would then sit down to work with a huge weight of expectation on his shoulders. Not wanting to blow such a public commission, he'd play it safe. This book had better command respect, and the way to ensure that would be to make it a tragedy. Audiences have to be enticed to laugh, but if you kill people they feel obliged to take you seriously. As everyone knows, America plus tragedy equals the Civil War, so that's what it would have to be about. Better stick to the standard cartoon version that the Civil War was about slavery; people would be confused otherwise; plus you can show a lot of strength and diversity. When finally completed twelve years later, the book would be a 900-page pastiche of existing popular novels — roughly Gone with the Wind plus Roots. But its bulk and celebrity would make it a bestseller for a few months, until blown out of the water by a talk-show host's autobiography. http://paulgraham.com/marginal.html
* bias towards big
> The eminent, on the other hand, are almost forced to work on a large scale. Instead of garden sheds they must design huge art museums. One reason they work on big things is that they can: like our hypothetical novelist, they're flattered by such opportunities. They also know that big projects will by their sheer bulk impress the audience. A garden shed, however lovely, would be easy to ignore; a few might even snicker at it. You can't snicker at a giant museum, no matter how much you dislike it. http://paulgraham.com/marginal.html
* symmetry
> Architects started consciously making buildings asymmetric in Victorian times and by the 1920s asymmetry was an explicit premise of modernist architecture. Even these buildings only tended to be asymmetric about major axes, though; there were hundreds of minor symmetries. http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html

* 🗄 `franzen-gaddis.pdf`
> Whatever the popular perception of the moment, whether in literary terms or social terms, the book is forced into the gestalt and media vocabulary of that moment. So it take about five years at least - if the book can stay in print that long and get circulated and read - for it to be seen in its own terms. 📙 Paris Review qt. Russell Banks [152]

music
> You can definitely hear that. There's a lot of feeling there, but not very much "emotion", at least in rock & roll terms - those records don't sound impassioned or declamatory, they're very blurry, but they're full of sensation. https://thequietus.com/articles/08745-kevin-shields-interview-mbv-my-bloody-valentine

> It's better to do nothing than to do bad work. https://thequietus.com/articles/08745-kevin-shields-interview-mbv-my-bloody-valentine
> In the wiggy abstraction of his self-regard, Robert Smith has evolved into a Brit art-pop archetype. Eccentric though his songs are, they offer nothing arresting in the way of imagery ("like a baby screams" and "it's so smooth it even feels like skin," which latter is admittedly pretty good, are as meaty as it gets), much less character or incident. They're not really observed--it's more like they're experienced at a distance. Yet they're not dreamlike, though while he's at it he does report on his dreams--it's more like he doesn't know the difference between loneliness, solipsism, and satori, with lots of stuff about loved ones (girlfriends, I mean) who one way or another aren't there, or real, or something. https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=the%20cure

> Look, there’s a weird game called “movie criticism”, where you take a movie as a jumping-off point to have thoughts on Society or the Human Condition. In the real world, people watch movies because they’re funny, or they have cool action sequences, or because the lead actress is really hot. But the rules of the “movie criticism” game say you have to ignore this stuff and treat them as deep commentary. https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-dont
* negative criticism less popular given cancel culture, psychological fragility of contemporary America https://unherd.com/2021/09/the-dying-art-of-the-hatchet-job/
> The only way a critic can ever respect any artist is by taking that artist seriously. And, though negative criticism is incredibly unpopular now, and routinely derided as “toxic,” praise means nothing if blame has been declared politically forbidden. Do you think Liz Phair, a musician whose career has been fantastically successful by any rational criteria, needs this kind of condescending white knight bullshit? https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/the-problem-with-liz-phairs-self
* "you could consider reading a book without knowing what you think about it until you've read it"
> I mean, in the most absurd expression of this tendency merely reading a book is assumed to associate you with its argument and author and culture. Like when people say "I saw this guy with Atlas Shrugged on the subway, it was so cringe." Literally, what the fuck are you talking about? Have you never imagined reading a book without wanting it to be a signifier of your entire personality? Do you know how many books I’ve read specifically because I hate the author and their outlook? Or, quelle horreur, you could consider reading a book without knowing what you think about it until you’ve read it! You know, the generative state of being open to forming a summative position based on the gradual aggregation of myriad minor judgments formed along the way? That would seem to be a major part of the point of reading. Even if someone outwardly professes to like a book that you don’t, I haven’t got a clue what you think that fact in isolation teaches you. Interests? I have a copy of Be Here Now on my shelf. I’ve never meditated in my life. Intelligence? One of the smartest people I know has a Family Guy tattoo.

* cross disciplinary
> Most of our classes in literature already involve philosophy and history (if not also sociology, art history, anthropology, economics, psychology, and the like). We may want to double down on this interdisciplinarity, seeing our courses as training in the humanities (in general), ourselves as humanists (in general), and our work as orienting our students to the big human questions, which are, after all, not constrained by the boundaries of the university’s disciplinary divisions. - Hayot https://profession.mla.org/the-sky-is-falling/
* poptimism
> It’s interesting to me to see such naked artistic classism at hand in artistic opinion again; the content industry derives an awful lot of clicks from pretending to oppose that sort of thing. I don’t mean classism to say that nü-metal was poor people music, but rather that it was and is perceived to appeal to base and populist tastes - in other words, the kind of tastes that the entire critical edifice has been championing for at least 15 years. This is the era of poptimism, as much as the poptimists like to pretend that isn’t the case, and we are now to understand that any preference for the experimental or challenging or niche is not just the hand of elitism but probably of racism and sexism as well. Yet Limb Bizkit et al were the epitome of a certain kind of shameless populism, and they are again coming up for mockery. I guess rules are meant to be broken. https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/nu-metal-and-twilight-are-the-true
> At some point "white guys with guitars" became a symbol of everything wrong with music. One of the stations of the poptimist cross is to denounce the indie rock that you used to listen to and write an essay on Pitchfork about how you now realize that Megan Thee Stallion’s music has been a greater force for racial justice than the NAACP. https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/if-youre-bound-to-be-bad-why-bother

* virtualy no music writing talks from the perspective of the musician
> These pieces belong to the journalistic or writerly critical tradition that comes before and comes after the academic critical tradition; they are marked by that academic tradition but are also trying to do something distinct from it. I like the idea of a criticism that tries to do three things at once: speaks about fiction as writers speak about their craft; writes criticism journalistically, with verve and appeal, for a common reader; and bends this criticism back towards the academy in the hope of influencing the kind of writing that is done there, mindful that the traffic between inside and outside the academy naturally goes both ways. https://lithub.com/james-wood-what-is-at-stake-when-we-write-literary-criticism/
* language as unifier
> The art critic does not paint her plaudits, but the book critic speaks "to literature in its own language." - think this is from Wood's essay collection
> Prose is always simple *in this sense*, because language is the ordinary medium of daily communication - unlike music or paint. [Wood 188]

* https://newrepublic.com/article/145265/paradoxical-politics-literary-criticism
> mid-twentieth-century literary studies..The dominant school of interpretation was New Criticism, whose defining method—close reading—consisted of scrutinizing short passages of literary works detached from their political context...new schools of interpretation...the late 1960s and early 1970s [postmodernism]...committed to the notion that a work of literature should be understood as responsive to its time...Still others have advocated for a quantitative, data-driven approach enabled by new digital technology.
> This rewriting of the goals of literary criticism has had far-reaching consequences. Decades later, leftist critics—including the likes of Raymond Williams, Terry Eagleton, and Fredric Jameson—recoil from New Criticism’s commitment to traditional cultural hierarchies, and reject aesthetic cultivation entirely. Embracing a wholly political approach to reading, these critics abandon what North believes is the one means by which literature might be made to reshape the world. Though they believe they are pushing literary studies to become more politically engaged, they are, North contends, doing the opposite. In their view, literature is primarily a vehicle of ideology, a way of masking the painful contradictions of capitalism. Their criticism treats literature as a symptom, valuable only as an indirect expression of the political forces that created it.
> It’s worth noting that North is himself producing historicist/contextualist scholarship: His book is focused on a narrowly defined historical context, the Anglo-American twentieth century, and he treats texts as symptoms of broader ideological forces. His book is polemical, but he is calling for, not producing, a new kind of criticism. This, too, is a widespread tendency. So many literary scholars these days seem to hope for a criticism that can crash through the walls of the academy, shape minds, melt hearts, and change the world. It is tempting to debunk their fantasies. But they may serve a necessary function. As North’s book demonstrates, continuing the modest but important work that literary studies does do may depend on its ability to imagine the work that it might do.

> Put simply, deconstruction proceeds on the assumption that literary texts, like people, have an unconscious that frequently betrays them: they say one thing but mean another thing... The critic can unravel—deconstruct—a text by reading it as one might read a Freudian slip....At university, I began to understand that a poem or novel might be self-divided, that its intentions might be beautifully lucid but its deepest motivations helplessly contradictory. Indeed, deconstruction tends to specialize in -— perhaps over-emphasize -- the ways in which texts contradict themselves...how Jane Austen’s novels are both proto-feminist and patriarchally structured; or how the great novels of adultery, like Anna Karenina and Madame Bovary and Effi Briest, dream of female transgression but simultaneously enforce punishment for that transgression. https://lithub.com/james-wood-what-is-at-stake-when-we-write-literary-criticism/

> Except for John Fowles, I hear no one pointing out that the tendency of all he says is wrong. He says it powerfully, with comi-tragic brilliance, and he believes it, but what he says is not quite sound. Every night Samuel Beckett goes home to his wife, whom he's lived with all these years; he lies down in bed with her, puts his arms around her, says, "No meaning again today..." Critics can say, and do say, Well, it doesn't matter what he says, it's how well he says it. But I think in the long run Beckett is in for it. Because great writers tell the truth exactly - and get it right. 📙 Paris Review qt. John Gardner [148]

> The man who knew his Milton, Pope, and Wordsworth was a civilized being. But this is only a partial explanation. You do not need dig far into the biographies of the leaders of that age to realize how thoroughly their understanding of the world was built around literature.

His thoughts were filtered through Shakespeare. https://scholars-stage.org/shakespeare-in-american-politics/
> If there is one theme that threads its way through the great sweep of the Chinese tradition, it is a tragic recognition that the world we live in is not designed to reward the life most worth living. It is found in the opening pages of Sima Qian’s historical masterwork. It is coded into the biography of Confucius, and debated by all of his intellectual heirs. Attempts to reconcile the pressures of the world with the honest life were made by the Mohist philosophers; the attempt was proclaimed impossible by both Daoists and Legalists (though for opposite reasons). The first named poet in Chinese history is survived by one poem, a lament on this theme. Be it the rural escapes of Tao Qian,  the drunken withdrawals of Li Bai, or the stubborn realism of Du Fu, this dilemma inspired the greatest of China’s poets in the millennia that followed. The great Chinese novels are obsessed with the topic: Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Outlaws of the Marsh ask if one can live righteously in ages of corruption and violence; The Scholars (and less obviously, Journey to the West) viciously satire those who try to do the same in ages of corruption and peace. The beautiful, sorrow-filled Dream of the Red Chamber embraces this tragedy as Chinese women lived it. And so on right into the modern era. At the turn of the 20th century, Lu Xun kicked off modern Chinese literature with a short story that paints Chinese social life as a choice between becoming a monster or being considered insane. These are just the most famous names of a 3,000 year tradition. To neglect it is to neglect a well of experience seemingly prepared for our day. https://scholars-stage.org/everything-is-worse-in-china/

> Cultural exchange always goes both ways. Yes, jazz is a quintessentially Black American artform, though all of the greatest Black jazzmen have given great credit to the white musicians who participated in its production. But to call jazz Black does not and cannot mean that it’s entirely distinct from white art as well. Jazz drew from ragtime, also “coded” Black, but ragtime drew from marches, drawn in great measure from white men John Philip Sousa and (eep) Wagner. Of course, there’s also march music from Bangladesh, Japan, Colombia, Turkey, even the Caucasus, home of the literal Caucasians, who are not very white. It’s turtles all the way down: you can’t ever get to the pure origins, because there are no origins. There’s mitochondrial DNA in culture, pure essence of human creativity that has no bedrock beyond what’s shared in the human experience. Trying to shed the bad adulterants and get to the pure cultural product, crafted only by the legitimate owners of that product, was stupid and futile when Goebbels attempted it and it’s just as stupid and futile when some Evergreen College sophomore tries to do it on social media using a iPhone that draws parts from 43 countries and scientific influence from vastly more. Gospel was a white artform before it was a Black one. Does that invalidate gospel as a part of the Black experience, make gospel “less Black”? It’s an absurd question. Yes, early rock and roll was deeply influenced by rhythm and blues and the Black artists who pioneered it. But it was also influenced by the skiffle movement among white artists in the United Kingdom - which in turn drew from Black jug bands, but also from white folk acts, who in turn were influenced by traditional European musical styles, which did not spring fully formed from the head of Odin but from a panoply of earlier predecessors that stretch back to the dawn of civilization. https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/theres-no-alternative-to-cultural

Chinese thinkers often assume that “discourse power,” “soft power,” and its like will come from exporting something uniquely Chinese to the rest of the world.

> Video game music, anime soundtracks, stuff like that have kind of always followed me. I was super into racing games, specifically simulation racing games. Most of them are Japanese-made, and Japanese video game companies have what they call "sound teams" — a group of musicians that pretty much program all the music for these different games. I fell in love with video game soundtracks because there were no words. I remember when I started making music, like, I told myself, even amidst all the learning how to rap, I had always told myself that the kind of music I wanted to make was instrumental, drum and bass, jungle. I learned how to use a program called Reason, and it’s very old school — not a lot of people use it, but I got Keith and Father onto it.

> You can see in this scene, and throughout the film, why John was forgiven for so much: he was just so bloody funny. His gift for comedy was not far short of his gift for music. He uses jokes to obstruct, obfuscate and deflect, and yet the undeniable truth is that he is a genuinely brilliant, lightning-quick, Peter Cook-level improviser. Paul has been laughing at John’s jokes since they spent every spare hour together in their parents’ homes. It’s hard to stay stern or angry when you’re laughing.

The good characters get over the bad done to them, things work out somewhat better than we expect and everyone muddles through.

Kenneth Tynan, he was a — I should say because no one knows who he is — he was a theater critic, started as a theater critic in England in the ’50s, and then in the late ’60s I think, early ’70s, came over to America and started writing for the New Yorker. And a very interesting thing happened to his writing. I don’t know to what extent it was a result of the New Yorker, or whether it was just him getting old, but when he was a young man, his writing was electric and baroque. The adjective-to-noun ratio was so high. Every sentence was encrusted with adjectives and adverbs, and there was no sentence that was just getting from A to B. It was so — what many would say overwritten, but I thought was so...It was just exciting...But an interesting thing happened, and I wonder which you prefer. Because as he got older, his writing got plainer and calmer, and it stopped jumping about, trying to arrest your attention...But I think there is something about taste today that prefers a clearer, more limpid kind of prose. While I understand that sometimes overwriting can be annoying, sometimes it’s just lazy. You read early Kenneth Tynan, and you realize people aren’t trying hard enough. You can’t just say "cup."

And communicating clearly and making it easy on your reader are pretty high up there in what good writing is trying to accomplish.

And, what he's getting at there--and he talks about how he influenced Burkhart[?] and others--but what he's trying to get at, and this was extremely helpful for me reading this book in conjunction with the Kenny G--your documentary--is that in the critical world, art is supposed to disturb you. It's supposed to shake you up. It's supposed to challenge you. If you like it right away, it's not good art. Can't be, almost by definition. And, Kenny G's work is not jarring. It's not challenging. You can like it the first time. You might not like it as much the 10th time, like you might, say, with the Rite of Spring, or Schoenberg, or others, or Miles Davis, or Coltrane. But, a lot of people like it the first time and they're totally happy with that. And, in the aesthetics of the critical world, that makes it a failure.
> Now, suppose that we found an album--it's a undiscovered album by The Beatles that was never released. Now, would you be, like, 'Oh, well, who cares? They were so 1960s, 1970s? I mean, music has come so far since then, don't you think? Would you really want another one of those?' And, of course, every Beatle fan would be very excited; and a lot of not-Beatle fans would be excited--because, they're great songs. What was beautiful then is still beautiful now. What's wrong with beauty?
> I mean it's historically so contingent. We didn't always think that art was for disturbing your psyche and, you know, causing trouble and maybe furthering the revolution. That's a pretty new idea about what art should be. As far as we know, art has traditionally served very different functions. Again, we're speculating to some extent, but it seems likely that, you know, in the past, before the modern era, that art was more about ritual and tradition and coming together, binding people together.
> There certainly are old works of nonfiction that are easier to read than Smith. And there are also margins where Gladwell’s prose is lacking where something from an earlier period is refined. But on the margins of clarity of communication and ease with which words enter your mind, I don’t think there is a single example of from, say, more than a hundred years ago, that matches Gladwell. And communicating clearly and making it easy on your reader are pretty high up there in what good writing is trying to accomplish. If someone had been able to write as effectively as Gladwell now does a hundred years ago, they would have done it. They didn’t. https://worksinprogress.co/issue/this-is-what-peak-culture-looks-like/
> One cannot read the diaries, letters, and editorials of 19th century America without wondering at their eloquence and erudition.

> Nor do I think adopting a willfully mature, low-volume stance is the answer; I love a lot of folkies, but the common progression of indie rockers toward Americana music has always struck me as a form of stylistic self-preservation instead of radical growth, a logical regression from thrift-store trash to antiques. And as much as I adore ripe weirdoes like Dylan, David Thomas, and Yoko Ono, eccentricity is a risky path to emulate, since its quirks often become ways of avoiding the entanglements of relationships and daily life. - https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-fest/powers.php

> So, the reason I bring this up is that, I think part of what offends people about Kenny G's music is that it is so useful. That it is useful as background music, in and of itself, I think makes some people pretty angry--because they don't want art to just be pleasant in the background. As you said, they want art to be disturbing society and changing the world and making you uncomfortable. And, if it's too pleasant--which is really what Kenny G's music is: it's just very pleasant, I guess--that's what it's aiming for and apparently it's what it achieves, right? Then that must be--there's something wrong with that; there's something bankrupt in there. And, I think the usefulness of the music--and it's even in the titles of the songs, "Going Home", "Sentimental", "Forever In Love"--like, these are song titles that tell you what the music is for. People don't use "Going Home" at the wedding. They use "Forever In Love" at the wedding. Now there's nothing about those songs that seems particularly important to say, 'This one's about going home and this one's about falling in love,' but the titles are giving you very helpful clues as to how to use it in your life. https://www.econtalk.org/penny-lane-on-loving-and-loathing-kenny-g/

## taste

pop
> What was about to happen was an unprecedented contradiction in terms, mass bohemianism, and this is where the idea of "pop" became key. Pop is what the mod Oldham shared with the bohemian Stones, and what they in turn shared with the teenyboppers. Applied first to low-priced classical concerts and then to Tin Pan Alley product, the word was beginning to achieve more general cultural currency by the mid-Fifties, when London-based visual artists like Eduardo Paolozzi were proposing that a schlock form (e.g., science fiction pulp) might nurture "a higher order of imagination" than a nominally experimental one (e.g., little magazine). Shocking. - https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/music/stones-76.php

taste is not subjective 📙 Graham hackers and painters 
> Proof by reductio ad absurdum...So if you want to discard the concept of good taste, you also have to discard the concept of good art. And that means you have to discard the possibility of people being good at making it. Which means there's no way for artists to be good at their jobs. And not just visual artists, but anyone who is in any sense an artist. You can't have good actors, or novelists, or composers, or dancers either. You can have popular novelists, but not good ones. http://www.paulgraham.com/goodtaste.html
> If everything a particle interacts with behaves as if the particle had a mass of m, then it has a mass of m...Particles interacting with one another are at one pole, but people interacting with art are not all the way at the other; their reactions aren't random...People do vary, and judging art is hard, especially recent art. There is definitely not a total order either of works or of people's ability to judge them. But there is equally definitely a partial order of both. So while it's not possible to have perfect taste, it is possible to have good taste.
> In fact this would do fairly well as a definition of politics: what determines rank in the absence of objective tests. http://paulgraham.com/marginal.html#f3n
> If you mention taste nowadays, a lot of people will tell you that "taste is subjective." They believe this because it really feels that way to them. When they like something, they have no idea why. http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html
> But if your job is to design things, and there is no such thing as beauty, then there is no way to get better at your job. If taste is just personal preference, then everyone's is already perfect: you like whatever you like, and that's it.
> It's hard to guess what the future will be like, but we can be sure it will be like the past in caring nothing for present fashions.
> I think it's because humor is related to strength. To have a sense of humor is to be strong: to keep one's sense of humor is to shrug off misfortunes, and to lose one's sense of humor is to be wounded by them. And so the mark-- or at least the prerogative-- of strength is not to take oneself too seriously. The confident will often, like swallows, seem to be making fun of the whole process slightly, as Hitchcock does in his films
> If there were good art, then people who liked it would have better taste than people who didn't. So if you discard taste, you also have to discard the idea of art being good, and artists being good at making it. http://www.paulgraham.com/goodart.html
> And yet you can see how great a hold "taste is subjective" has even in the art world by how nervous it makes people to talk about art being good or bad. Those whose jobs require them to judge art, like curators, mostly resort to euphemisms like "significant" or "important" or (getting dangerously close) "realized."
> the concept of good has been retired. Instead everyone is just supposed to explore their own personal vision.
> When I was in art school, we were looking one day at a slide of some great fifteenth century painting, and one of the students asked "Why don't artists paint like that now?" The room suddenly got quiet. Though rarely asked out loud, this question lurks uncomfortably in the back of every art student's mind. It was as if someone had brought up the topic of lung cancer in a meeting within Philip Morris. "Well," the professor replied, "we're interested in different questions now." He was a pretty nice guy, but at the time I couldn't help wishing I could send him back to fifteenth century Florence to explain in person to Leonardo & Co. how we had moved beyond their early, limited concept of art. Just imagine that conversation.
> The problem is not so much the day to day management. Really good hackers are practically self-managing. The problem is, if you're not a hacker, you can't tell who the good hackers are. A similar problem explains why American cars are so ugly. I call it the design paradox. You might think that you could make your products beautiful just by hiring a great designer to design them. But if you yourself don't have good taste, how are you going to recognize a good designer? By definition you can't tell from his portfolio. And you can't go by the awards he's won or the jobs he's had, because in design, as in most fields, those tend to be driven by fashion and schmoozing, with actual ability a distant third. There's no way around it: you can't manage a process intended to produce beautiful things without knowing what beautiful is. American cars are ugly because American car companies are run by people with bad taste. http://paulgraham.com/gh.html

fashion
* signaling, looking cool, knowingness https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/the-rise-and-fall-of-online-culture
> There is nothing so unfashionable as the last, discarded fashion http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html
> It's one thing to like what everybody likes. You don't want to be the contrarian when you're young. But, it's really important to dislike what everybody dislikes.
> And so, with Kenny G at this point, if you want to rebel against your Boomer parents, the best thing you could do is say, 'Oh, I love this Kenny G song, "Songbird." It's so great.'...it's about defying expectations and having that be a way of bringing you and your friends together. https://www.econtalk.org/penny-lane-on-loving-and-loathing-kenny-g/
> It’s the terrible modern condition where everyone seems compelled to act at all times as if they already know everything, as if nothing is surprising, as if they anticipated your question and not only know the answer but are deeply unimpressed with you for asking. The singular obsession is to be savvy, an insider. https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/what-happened-to-you-motherfucker

> Bell says: cool people keep trying to come up with some external signal they can use to identify themselves as cool. Uncool people keep trying to copy the signal so they can look cool too. After a while, so many uncool people are using the signal that it's no longer a good identifier of coolness, and so cool people need to switch to a new signal. Thus the fashion cycle and its constant changes.
* consensus = blandness https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene_paradox 📙 Hayek order
* the arts are too conservative
> Which in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e. less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete). http://paulgraham.com/worked.html#f12n
> Everyone values safety too much, both the obscure and the eminent. No one wants to look like a fool. But it's very useful to be able to. If most of your ideas aren't stupid, you're probably being too conservative. You're not bracketing the problem. http://paulgraham.com/marginal.html
* some forms just go out of favor
> Despite its manifest excellence, this new work has not found a public beyond the poetry subculture, because the traditional machinery of transmission—the reliable reviewing, honest criticism, and selective anthologies—has broken down.

Today Walt Whitman's challenge "To have great poets, there must be great audiences, too" reads like an indictment. https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1991/05/can-poetry-matter/305062/
> Where is the cultural-change equivalent of Progress Studies, and what might we be able to do if we had it?
> in my more optimistic moments, I dare to hope that the tribal-intellectual cycle is speeding up: paganism-to-Christianity took countless years, Catholicism-to-Protestantism took 1200, Protestantism-to-Enlightenment 250, and so on. But I think this probably tracks economic doubling times, and those have stopped getting shorter recently.
* https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/theses-on-the-current-moment https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/04/respectability-cascades/
> So we have two opposite lessons. In the first, 0%-respectable-people taking up a cause is a good and necessary first step, and means that soon 10% and 20% respectable people will take it up. It is the beginning of a respectability cascade that will redeem the cause from the pit of taboo-ness permanently. In the second, 0%-respectable-people taking up a cause dooms it forever. It is the beginning of a disrespectability cascade that will make the cause too toxic for anyone above that respectability level to ever dare associate with.
* balance in social conditions helps create interesting art, Nisbet https://douthat.substack.com/p/decadence-and-the-intellectuals
> My own favored explanation, in The Decadent Society, is adapted from Robert Nisbet’s arguments about how cultural golden ages hold traditional and novel forces in creative tension: The problem, as I see it, is that this tension snapped during the revolutions of the 1960s, when the Baby Boomers (and the pre-Boomer innovators they followed) were too culturally triumphant and their elders put up too little resistance, such that the fruitful tension between innovation and tradition gave way to confusion, mediocrity, sterility.
> I may be over-influenced here by the Catholic experience, where I think the story definitely applies. As R.R. Reno argued in a 2007 survey of the so-called “heroic generation” in Catholic theology, the great theologians of the Vatican II era displayed their brilliance in their critique of the old Thomism, but then the old system precipitously collapsed and subsequent generation lacked the grounding required to be genuinely creatively in their turn, or eventually even to understand what made the 1960s generation so significant in the first place
> Which brings us back to the question of traditionalism and dynamism, and their potential interaction: If you’ve had a cultural revolution that cleared too much ground, razed too many bastions and led to a kind of cultural debasement and forgetting, you probably need to go backward, or least turn that way for recollection, before you can hope to go forward once again.
* middlebrow (90%-99%) highbrow (1%) https://www.themoneyillusion.com/understanding-middlebrow
> A company like Netflix can’t become big and rich by appealing to the audience that likes films directed by Tarkovsky and Hou Hsiao-shien. And do you really expect the Academy to give out Best Picture awards in a way that implicitly acknowledges that most Hollywood directors are not in fact "artists", and the makes the TV viewers at home feel dumb? The NYT has 7.5 million subscribers, mostly progressives in the 90-99% range. These people feel very smart, and they are in fact smarter than 90% of the population. So there’s no point bemoaning the fact that the NYT is not about to tell it’s readers that, "Actually, we provide middlebrow news analysis, and if you want brilliant inspired analysis you need to read blogs like SlateStarCodex."
> Everything that was once considered lowbrow is now triumphant. It is still common for people to talk of “guilty” cultural pleasures—TV, dance music—about which no one has felt guilty in decades, and to apologize for them with an enthusiasm that looks a lot like pride. https://hedgehogreview.com/issues/who-do-we-think-we-are/articles/the-strange-undeath-of-middlebrow

It will be about whatever you discover in the course of writing it. http://paulgraham.com/nthings.html

> I think the goal of an essay should be to discover surprising things. That's my goal, at least. And most surprising means most different from what people currently believe. So writing to persuade and writing to discover are diametrically opposed. The more your conclusions disagree with readers' present beliefs, the more effort you'll have to expend on selling your ideas rather than having them. As you accelerate, this drag increases, till eventually you reach a point where 100% of your energy is devoted to overcoming it and you can't go any faster. It's hard enough to overcome one's own misconceptions without having to think about how to get the resulting ideas past other people's. I worry that if I wrote to persuade, I'd start to shy away unconsciously from ideas I knew would be hard to sell. When I notice something surprising, it's usually very faint at first. There's nothing more than a slight stirring of discomfort. I don't want anything to get in the way of noticing it consciously.

> But the modern debate might be said to have begun in 1934 when Edmund Wilson published the first version of his controversial essay "Is Verse a Dying Technique?" Surveying literary history, Wilson noted that verse's role had grown increasingly narrow since the eighteenth century. In particular, Romanticism's emphasis on intensity made poetry seem so "fleeting and quintessential" that eventually it dwindled into a mainly lyric medium. As verse - which had previously been a popular medium for narrative, satire, drama, even history and scientific speculation - retreated into lyric, prose usurped much of its cultural territory. Truly ambitious writers eventually had no choice but to write in prose. The future of great literature, Wilson speculated, belonged almost entirely to prose. - Dana Gioia https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1991/05/can-poetry-matter/305062/
> The ceaseless ta-tum, ta-tum of Longfellow's Hiawatha is ideal for recitation and memorization. Marcus pokes fun at Longfellow's extended similes, but here again we find a poetic device designed for someone listening to poetry. The listener cannot 'pause' the poem to ponder out what a given metaphor might mean, but must instead catch this meaning before the reciter moves forward with the narrative. Spending extra lines on a clever metaphor ensures that a listener is able comprehend it in time. Modernism, free verse forms, and the puzzle-like nature of so much modern poetry are all fruits of this transition - the transition from the social and spoken to the solitary and written...There are older poems of the puzzling sort...John Donne's poems are a perfect example of this...but then again, John Donne's verse was largely ignored until the 20th century, when T.S. Eliot agitated for his central place in the canon. As with Emily Dickinson, Donne's rehabilitation is a story of meditative, cryptic lyricists lionizing poets from the past who most approached their own ideals. https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2021/02/longfellow-and-decline-of-american.html

> By proclamation and by vocal method--he slurs as a matter of conviction, articulating only catchphrases--Jagger belittles his own lyrics, an appropriate stance for a literate man who has bet his life on the comparative inexplicitness of music. Nonetheless, Jagger's lyrics were much like the Stones' music, aesthetically: pungent and vernacular ("Who wants yesterday's papers"); achieving considerable specificity with familiar materials ("You got me running like a cat in a thunderstorm"); and challenging conventional perceptions more by their bite than by any notable eloquence or profundity ("They just get married 'cause there's nothing else to do"). But whereas the Stones' music extended rock and roll usages, Jagger's lyrics often contravened them. He wrote more hate songs than love songs, and related tales of social and political breakdown with untoward glee. The hypocrisy and decay of the upper classes was a fave subject--many songs that seem basically antiwoman (although certainly not all of them) are actually more antirich. He was also capable of genuine gusto about sex (not as often as is thought, but consider the openhearted anticipation of "Goin' Home" or "Let's Spend the Night Together") and wrote the most accurate LSD song ever, "Something Happened to Me Yesterday." - https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/music/stones-76.php

> The unreality of painted people standing on a platform saying things they've said to each other for months is more than I can overlook...A play is a verbal ballet, and I mean to include in that equation some strong reservations about ballet...a play's capacity is a fraction of a novel's. Shakespeare, and to a lesser extent, wrote their plays as "turns" and exercises for actors they knew -- without Will Kempe, no Falstaff. Without this chance of intimacy, the chances of life creeping into a play are slight. 📙 Paris Rreview qt. Updike [297]

* plays off plays: Seneca phaedra Stoppard rosencrantz & guildenstern
> Nine of Seneca's tragedies survive, all of which are fabula crepidata (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his Phaedra, for example, was based on Euripides' Hippolytus.
* origins in religion, court https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_theatre
> This similarity of early theatre to ritual is negatively attested by Aristotle, who in his Poetics defined theatre in contrast to the performances of sacred mysteries: theatre did not require the spectator to fast, drink the kykeon, or march in a procession; however theatre did resemble the sacred mysteries in the sense that it brought purification and healing to the spectator by means of a vision, the theama. The physical location of such performances was accordingly named theatron.[2]
> By the Early Middle Ages, churches in Europe began staging dramatized versions of particular biblical events on specific days of the year. These dramatizations were included in order to vivify annual celebrations.[34] Symbolic objects and actions – vestments, altars, censers, and pantomime performed by priests – recalled the events which Christian ritual celebrates. These were extensive sets of visual signs that could be used to communicate with a largely illiterate audience. These performances developed into liturgical dramas, the earliest of which is the Whom do you Seek (Quem-Quaeritis) Easter trope, dating from ca. 925.[34] Liturgical drama was sung responsively by two groups and did not involve actors impersonating characters
> The end of medieval drama came about due to a number of factors, including the weakening power of the Catholic Church, the Protestant Reformation and the banning of religious plays in many countries. Elizabeth I forbid all religious plays in 1558 and the great cycle plays had been silenced by the 1580s. Similarly, religious plays were banned in the Netherlands in 1539, the Papal States in 1547 and in Paris in 1548
> Puritan opposition to the stage (informed by the arguments of the early Church Fathers who had written screeds against the decadent and violent entertainments of the Romans) argued not only that the stage in general was pagan, but that any play that represented a religious figure was inherently idolatrous. In 1642, at the outbreak of the English Civil War, the Puritan authorities banned the performance of all plays within the city limits of London. A sweeping assault against the alleged immoralities of the theatre crushed whatever remained in England of the dramatic tradition.
> At the end of the Late Middle Ages, professional actors began to appear in England and Europe. Richard III and Henry VII both maintained small companies of professional actors. Their plays were performed in the Great Hall of a nobleman's residence, often with a raised platform at one end for the audience and a "screen" at the other for the actors. Also important were Mummers' plays, performed during the Christmas season, and court masques.

> Yet the art world itself is based on principles fairly different from Woke and often directly opposed to Woke. First and foremost, the art world is based on ownership of property.  Most (by no means all) of those properties were created by dead white males, or perhaps by living white males. Art markets typically are ruled by Power Laws and massive inequality, with most works going to zero value and a small percentage of the creators hitting it big.  No one in those worlds really thinks that is going to change, or should change.  Indeed, you earn status by showing how discriminating your eye is, which means by dumping on the works that aren’t going anywhere...One lesson is that when no one is watching, and when actual property is at stake, the contemporary world is still remarkably sensible. https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/07/the-art-newspaper.html
* taste
> Paris was once a great intellectual center. If you went there in 1300, it might have sent the message Cambridge does now. But I tried living there for a bit last year, and the ambitions of the inhabitants are not intellectual ones. The message Paris sends now is: do things with style. I liked that, actually. Paris is the only city I've lived in where people genuinely cared about art. In America only a few rich people buy original art, and even the more sophisticated ones rarely get past judging it by the brand name of the artist. But looking through windows at dusk in Paris you can see that people there actually care what paintings look like. Visually, Paris has the best visual eavesdropping I know... If Paris is where people care most about art, why is New York the center of gravity of the art business? Because in the twentieth century, art as brand split apart from art as stuff. New York is where the richest buyers are, but all they demand from art is brand, and since you can base brand on anything with a sufficiently identifiable style, you may as well use the local stuff. http://paulgraham.com/cities.html

The C camera, he described as a "guerrilla unit."

form as determinant
> Greek philosophers before Plato wrote in verse. This must have affected what they said. If you try to write about the nature of the world in verse, it inevitably turns into incantation. Prose lets you be more precise, and more tentative. - http://www.paulgraham.com/philosophy.html#f3n
> The ideal medium seemed the short story, which I've since learned had quite a brief life, roughly coincident with the peak of magazine publishing. But since their size made them perfect for use in high school classes, we read a lot of them, which gave us the impression the short story was flourishing. Mistake number three. And because they were so short, nothing really had to happen; you could just show a randomly truncated slice of life, and that was considered advanced. Mistake number four. The result was that I wrote a lot of stories in which nothing happened except that someone was unhappy in a way that seemed deep. - http://paulgraham.com/copy.html
> there’s a lot you can do with hundreds of carefully wrought, tightly integrated pages that won’t work in the kinds of short forms encouraged on the Web - http://jsomers.net/blog/short-forms 
> Things 'happen' in motions pictures. There is always a resolution, always a strong cause-effect dramatic line, and to perceive the world in those terms is to assume an ending for every social scenario. [88]

* _episodic_: overarching plot (Gilligan’s Island: get off the island) w/ each episode as freestanding enactment thereof w/ reset to perennial plot conditions at episode’s end 📙 Wu [334]
* _serial_: overarching plot (The Wire: law and order in Baltimore) w/ each episode altering plot in some way
* previous use in literature e.g. Count of Monte Cristo
* enabled by streaming
> OTT video has also transformed content. As content has shifted online, serialized long-form storytelling has become dominant. Rich, plot driven series like Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones aren’t viable if the audience can’t catch most (if not all) original airings exactly when they start. Without the ability to catch up on a show mid-run, these series would never be able to attract new viewers and would decline in reach with every episode forever. The removal of commercials, meanwhile, meant that series no longer needed to be structured around ad breaks that occur every four to six minutes, or plotted so that scene would be exciting and/or funny enough to get a viewer to come back after a commercial. Similarly, a show could be any length. https://www.matthewball.vc/all/audiotech
