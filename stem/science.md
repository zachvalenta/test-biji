https://austinvernon.eth.link/blog/airtravel.html
> The trend in air travel technology is more flights between smaller airports...The fuel consumption of this 6-passenger plane is more like a car at 15-20 MPG. A light jet gets 2-3 MPG. Increased fuel efficiency means it will possibly serve any city pair in the US without refueling...A plane like this completely opens the air taxi market. A group of six people could fly private for a similar cost as commercial air travel.
> At some point, regulators will need to consider that driving is dramatically more dangerous than flying. Taking some risks in moving to more single pilots, reducing aircraft landing and take-off spacing, liability reform, and making certification of new planes easier would save human lives. The FAA and other parts of the government have shown that they are rarely capable of making these tradeoffs.
> I would say it is inevitable, except our current regulatory regime significantly lowers the probability that these technologies come to fruition. Even if they do survive, they will arrive decades later than they could have. You'll have to set the RemindMe! on this post for 2030.

> they had a purely Mendelian (as opposed to polygenic) model of intelligence, and felt that bad traits were probably caused by single recessive genes. This dichotomized the population in a way that contributed to the moral problems - if IQ is truly a continuum, then someone with 120 IQ might still wonder if they were “inferior” to someone with 130 IQ, in a way that made them feel some sympathy to someone with 80 IQ who was being pronounced “inferior” by the eugenicists of the time. But instead, they thought some people had the specific recessive “low intelligence” gene, those people could be “cleansed” from the population, and then everyone else would be fine! It also prevented them from considering improving the populace by encouraging intelligent people to breed more (as opposed to sterilizing unintelligent people) - this wouldn’t eliminate the recessive variants that were causing all the trouble! I’m confused how they could have believed this even with the limited knowledge of the time; this was long after Galton had proven that genius was genetic, and once you have genetic genius you know there’s more going on than Mendelian inheritance of subnormality. https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/links-for-february

You would also tell politicians that America has too many doctors already. That way, you could purposefully constrain the number of medical-school students. You might freeze or slash funding for residencies and medical scholarships. You’d fight proposals to allow nurses to do the work of physicians. And because none of this would stop foreign-trained doctors from slipping into the country and committing the crime of helping sick people get better, you’d throw in some rules that made it onerous for immigrant doctors, especially from neighboring countries Mexico and Canada, to do their job.
> The medical schools say they can’t easily expand, because there aren’t enough residency slots for their graduates to fill. But there aren’t enough residency slots because Washington has purposefully limited federal residency financing.

> Masking still will push infections further into the future, but if the vaccines become marginally less effective over time, as some data suggest, people may be slightly worse off later on (they’ll also be a bit older). The upshot is that the case for masking is less strong, even if you still think it is a good idea overall. Still, many people prefer to abide by fixed rules and principles. Once they learn them and lecture others about them, they are unlikely to change their minds. "Masking is good!" is a simple precept.

While this particular argument was silly, there was a widespread understanding that mandatory face coverings are an assault on a person’s identity and make normal human interaction much more difficult. That’s the entire reason why religious conservatives favor it, as they make men and women less likely to socialize and have premarital sex. Now, in schools, in many jobs, and in some places, whenever you’re indoors, we require both sexes to cover their faces, and we should not normalize this as a “low cost” intervention and feel grateful that at least they’re not locking us in our houses. https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/reflections-on-2021

> So I think it’s not actually inexplicable because the FDA has a long, long history of just hating people testing themselves. So the FDA was against pregnancy tests, they didn’t like that, they said women they need to consult with a doctor, only the physician can do the test because literally women could become hysterical if they were pregnant or if they weren’t pregnant, this was a safety issue. There was no question that the test itself was safe or worked. Instead what the FDA said, “We can regulate this because the user using it, this could create safety issues because they could commit suicide or they could do something crazy.” So they totally expanded the meaning of safety from is the test safe to can somebody be trusted to use a pregnancy test? Then we had exactly the same thing with AIDS testing. So we delayed personal at-home tests for AIDS for literally 25 years. 25 years these tests were unavailable because the FDA again said, “Well, they’re dangerous.” And why are they dangerous? “Well, we don’t know what people will do with this knowledge about their own bodies.” Now, of course, you can get an HIV test from Amazon and the world hasn’t collapsed. They did the same thing with genetic tests from companies like 23andMe. So I said, “Our bodies ourselves, our DNA ourselves.” That people have a right to know about the functioning of their own bodies. This to me is a very clear violation of the Constitutions on multiple respects. It just stuns me, it just stuns me that anybody could think that you don’t have a right to know, we’re going to prevent you from learning something about the operation of your own body. https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/05/testing-freedom.html

Meanwhile, it is still possible to enter the U.S. from Indonesia, which is arguably the current global center of the pandemic. In contrast, life seems to be orderly in most parts of China, and some European countries have vaccinated more of their citizens than the U.S.
> Consider that the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the Covid vaccines is still what is called an emergency use authorization, and the agency will not commit to a time frame for giving them full approval. At the same time, virtually every branch of America’s federal, state and local governments is working hard to convince people that getting vaccinated is imperative. Both sides cannot be right in their perspective and messaging. (To me the issue is clear: The FDA ought to give immediate full approval to what are already the best-studied vaccines in human history.)

So a common sense category of “look, we’re not telling you it’s so dangerous that it should be illegal, but we don’t really think we should pay for it” doesn’t exist.
> In the short term, Pfizer is selling literally every dose of vaccine it can produce. So Pfizer doesn’t care about how quickly it moves off of EUA. To them, it’s completely irrelevant. Global demand for the vaccine is outstripping their productive capacity, they are eschewing price increases because that would make people angry, and so while full approval could be a big deal for American public health, it’s nothing to Pfizer. By contrast, getting the FDA to agree that everyone should get periodic booster shots is worth a lot to Pfizer over the long term. So they are hard at work on working the regulatory process with an aim of boosting sales in 2023, and are beyond and sort of checked out from the question of whether or not all eligible personnel are vaccinated in time for the school year to start.

> Lots of the public sector in the United States is conducted by institutions that are not particularly technocratic in their design or their operation. But the Fed and the FDA are. These are institutions that employ a lot of technical specialists and that have a tradition of independence from the White House. In the long run, I think the way technocratic institutions safeguard their independence and build their legitimacy is by doing a good job. You want people to think “these guys seem like they know what they are doing.” And to me, the pattern of ignoring first-order cost-benefit considerations and then appealing to public confidence as the explanation of why that’s okay does the opposite. It suggests that the large-ish minority of people who are quantitatively competent need to all be doing their own analyses of issues like supplementing an initial J&J dose with a booster, and that basically every policy decision needs to be litigated and re-litigated in the public square. That’s not going to foster long-term confidence. If you want that, you need to make decisions that are justifiable on the merits.

> You may be surprised to learn that of the trio of long-awaited coronavirus vaccines, the most promising, Moderna’s mRNA-1273, which reported a 94.5 percent efficacy rate on November 16, had been designed by January 13. This was just two days after the genetic sequence had been made public in an act of scientific and humanitarian generosity that resulted in China’s Yong-Zhen Zhang’s being temporarily forced out of his lab. In Massachusetts, the Moderna vaccine design took all of one weekend. It was completed before China had even acknowledged that the disease could be transmitted from human to human, more than a week before the first confirmed coronavirus case in the United States. By the time the first American death was announced a month later, the vaccine had already been manufactured and shipped to the National Institutes of Health for the beginning of its Phase I clinical trial. This is — as the country and the world are rightly celebrating — the fastest timeline of development in the history of vaccines. It also means that for the entire span of the pandemic in this country, which has already killed more than 250,000 Americans, we had the tools we needed to prevent it. -> https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-design.html

* failure to do cost-benefit analysis https://cspicenter.org/blog/cspi/new-mission-at-cspi/
> Epidemiologists began by telling us COVID-19 was nothing to worry about and that masks did not work. They failed to understand and communicate the simple fact that this was a respiratory disease, not one that spread through contact with surfaces. And while, as Philippe Lemoine shows, it may have been rational to support lockdowns when our knowledge was limited, when it became clear that they didn’t have much of an effect, most restrictions should have been lifted given their massive costs. A recent poll of epidemiologists showed that 81% of them wanted to keep Americans wearing masks indoors for at least another year, despite the invention of a vaccine that brings the risk of hospitalization or death to zero, and the fact that we are approaching the point where everyone who wants a vaccine is able to get one for free. The next public health crisis may cause us to defer to the same experts again, a truly frightening thought given their extreme irrationality. These failures cannot be explained by epidemiology being too hard of a science. We know this because, throughout the pandemic, non-epidemiologists like Alex Tabarrok and Zeynep Tufekci have usually been ahead of the field, which has all but admitted this by eventually moving to their position weeks or months after they originally made their arguments. It is not simply that the prominent epidemiologists are wrong, but that they refuse to do anything resembling cost-benefit analysis.
> There are recurring themes in the inability of American society to deal with important challenges: political bias driving scientific conclusions; the practice of “safetyism” in which trade-offs are ignored; and expertise claiming authority on the basis of credentialism and often useless domain-specific knowledge, rather than an ability to engage in statistical reasoning and cost-benefit analysis.

> remember that Kuhn may already be in the water supply, so to speak. He argues against a simplistic view of science in which it is merely the gradual accumulation of facts. So Aristotle discovered a few true facts, Galileo added a few more on, then Newton discovered a few more, and now we have very many facts indeed.
> Kuhn says this isn’t true. Science isn’t just facts. It’s paradigms – whole ways of looking at the world. Without a paradigm, scientists wouldn’t know what facts to gather, how to collect them, or what to do with them once they had thema.
> Kuhn interestingly dismisses these areas as “the fields where people write books” – if you want to say anything, you might as well address it to a popular audience for all the good other people’s pre-existing knowledge will do you, and you may have to spend hundreds of pages explaining your entire system from the ground up. He throws all the social sciences in this bin – you may read Freud, Skinner, and Beck instead of Aristotle, Locke, and Kant, but it’s the same situation. A real science is one where everyone agrees on a single paradigm. Newtonianism and Einsteinianism are the same kind of things as Aristotelianism and utilitarianism; but in 1850, everybody believed the former, and in 1950, the latter.

> What we call "science" has changed immensely since WWII. For one thing, it’s way bigger. In 1950, the federal government gave about $100 million per year (in 2021 dollars) to universities for the purpose of basic research. That’s now more than $20B per year. If we look at R&D across the economy as a whole (though that's harder to measure reliably), nominal spending has supposedly grown by a similar magnitude. If we look at numbers of researchers, same story: about 10x more research doctorates are awarded every year today than were in 1950. And how we do it has changed. For example, peer review in the modern -- legitimacy-conferring -- sense of the term is a postwar invention and arose more as a result of funding bureaucracies and controversies than any scientific exigency. (Einstein was very offended in 1936 when the editor of Physical Review shared his now-famous EPR paper for an external opinion.) Lots of people have documented (and decried) the increasingly gerontocratic aspects of modern science and the growing age of grant recipients. However you cut it, what we're talking about when we say "science" just isn't close to the thing it was seventy years ago.
> With this ethos and panoply of strictures, it turns out that California is almost functionally incapable of constructing a high speed rail line connecting its two major metro regions. California has less civilizational capacity than the France of the 70s that built the TGV!...This is, obviously, mostly because of the regulations the state's inhabitants put in place that block the housing that's required to support California’s economic success. As a result, California has lost the "technology" of being able to affordably house its inhabitants. In these ways and many others, technology is both advancing rapidly and yet often receding in the state...And it's not just California. It's hard to look at Germany, where 77% of inhabitants say that their government has done a good job responding to the pandemic, take stock of the COVID vaccination rate (under 5%, compared to more than 22% in the UK and 73% in Israel), and to not raise an eyebrow. So: what's going on in our culture -- do we just not want good things?
> Mancur Olson was, I think, right in his focus on institutional dynamics and how principal/agent issues and collective action problems seep into our systems over time.
> As a prefatory point, "why has progress been slow?" might be approaching things backwards -- maybe it's better to puzzle over "why is it ever fast?" or “why does it exist at all?”. The vast majority of human societies generate very little meaningful frontier progress most of the time! (As compared to Solow-style catch-up growth.)...And I'll reiterate the point that most cultures through time haven't been, I think, especially conducive to progress or innovation, so I'd also invert -- maybe we should just identify those that were and try to figure out what it was that was special about them. As a meta point, cultural questions are tough for anyone to write about since even true diagnoses will never be wholly convincing (we have no counterfactuals) and because culture is a topic that people are often quite sensitive about. I thought that this was a pretty neat paper but lots of estimable onlookers stronglydisagreed. As a result of these inhibitory forces, I suspect that good scholarship here is underprovisioned.

Most of its fellows collaborate with universities that generate fresh data from “wet” labs— the ones with autoclaves and genetically engineered mice—and other facilities. The institute’s algorithms and computer models are meant to help its fellows uncover information hidden in data sets that have already been collected: inferring the location of new planets from the distorted space-time that surrounds them; identifying links to mutations among apparently functionless parts of chromosomes.

Simons https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/12/18/jim-simons-the-numbers-king
> The Flatiron Institute is part of a trend in the sciences toward privately funded research. In the United States, basic science has traditionally been paid for by universities or by the government, but private institutes are often faster and more focussed, and the world is awash in new fortunes. Since the nineties, when Silicon Valley began minting billionaires, private institutes have sprung up across the country. In 1997, Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle, launched the Ellison Medical Foundation, in the Bay Area, to study the biology of aging. Six years later, the Allen Institute for Brain Science, in Seattle, was founded by Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft. In 2010, Eric Schmidt, Google’s executive chairman, founded the Schmidt Ocean Institute, in Palo Alto.
> These institutes have done much good, in part by providing alternatives to sclerotic systems: the Allen Institute has helped change how neuroscience is done, speeding it up with such tools as automated microscopy. But private foundations also have liabilities. Wealthy benefactors inevitably direct their funding toward their personal enthusiasms. “The fear with these billionaire donors is that they’ll fund junky science, wasting money and time,” David Callahan, the editor of the online magazine Inside Philanthropy, said. Foundations are not taxed, so much of the money that supports them is money that otherwise would have gone to the government. Scientific mega-donors answer to no one but themselves. Private institutes tend to have boards chosen by their founders, and are designed to further the founders’ wishes, even beyond their deaths. Rob Reich, a professor of political science at Stanford University and an expert on philanthropy, told me, “Private foundations are a plutocratic exercise of power that’s unaccountable, nontransparent, donor-directed, and generously tax-subsidized. This seems like a very peculiar institutional and organizational form to champion in a democratic society.”
> Edward McCaffery, a law professor and a tax-policy expert at the University of Southern California, said, in an e-mail, “Democrats like Simons, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett might end up giving away all or most of their wealth to charities of their choice, but they and their families still lead lives of great power and privilege, with little tax. And their charities reflect their values, without necessarily helping ordinary— and taxpaying—citizens.”The taxes from an eight-billion-dollar fortune could fund a lot of schools.
>  “Originally, all science was supported by philanthropy. Galileo had his patrons.”
> In 2012, he and Marilyn convened an informal conference at the Buttermilk Falls Hotel, in upstate New York. Participants were asked to identify collaborative, goal-driven projects that were not being funded by other sources. This was a technique that he had often used: tapping the opinions of well-informed people and then making a decision with his gut. “Taste in science is very important,” Simons told me. “To distinguish what’s a good problem and what’s a problem that no one’s going to care about the answer to anyway—that’s taste. And I think I have good taste.”
> For some participants, the gathering offered an opportunity to pitch ambitious projects to a potential patron. This represented a return to an old way of doing science. In the years before the Second World War, Rockefeller University private institutions such as Rockefeller University, in Manhattan, and Rockefeller University the Institute for Advanced Study, which was funded by the Bamberger’s National department-store heirs, came of age. But by the  fties the National National Institutes of Health National Science Foundation Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and other Institutes of Health National Science Foundation governmental organizations were paying for the vast majority of scientific research in America.
> Governmental granting organizations, such as the National Science Foundation, tend to give money for incremental research. People with sustained track records are favored; the average age of scientists with a Ph.D. who receive their first grant from the National Institutes of Health is forty-three. Speculative projects are generally avoided.
> Simons’s willingness to pay more than the most élite academic institutions makes many people uncomfortable. Ray Madoff, who runs the Boston College Law School Forum on Philanthropy and the Public Good, said, “It shows what a lot of people suspected, which is that the wealthy play by their own rules. The rich are running things, and we’re just visiting their world.” It wasn’t so long ago that private foundations could be established only by an act of Congress, in part because they were considered so inimical to democracy. In 1913, Congress refused John D. Rockefeller’s request to establish his foundation. He had to go to the New York State Legislature for a charter instead.

If I had been awarded a five-year $62,500/year grant with the sole condition of "do research", I would almost certainly have persevered in academia and — despite working on the more interesting but longer-term questions — have had enough publications after those five years to obtain a continuing academic position. But that's not how granting agencies work; they give out one or two year awards, with the understanding that those who are successful will apply for more funding later. In short, academic institutions systemically promote exactly the sort of short-term optimization of which, ironically, the private sector is often accused. - Percival http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2020-09-20-On-the-use-of-a-life.html
> The reason nothing has been done since the 50s, despite everyone knowing about the problems, is simple: bad incentives. The best cases for government intervention are collective action problems: situations where the incentives for each actor cause suboptimal outcomes for the group as a whole, and it's difficult to coordinate bottom-up solutions. In this case the negative effects are not confined to academia, but overflow to society as a whole when these false results are used to inform business and policy. - https://fantasticanachronism.com/2020/09/11/whats-wrong-with-social-science-and-how-to-fix-it/

open science
* _open access_: scientific research funded by government money should be available to the public (vs. being paid for by public money in research funding and in university access) https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/01/can-open-access-scientific-publishing-work.html https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZUdd765nA4

> There's two issues here. The biggest driver of increase emissions if foreigners move here is that they just become more prosperous...the solution to the climate change problem can't just be that everyone who's poor just gonna stay poor forever. On the one hand that would be immoral and on the other hand that just wouldn't work. The United States does not have the capacity to stop India and Vietnam and Nigeria and Kenya from trying to industrialize and become more prosperous, they're not going to do it. Then conversely, the United States is on a per capita basis the biggest emitter, we're on a historical basis we're still the biggest emitter, but on a current basis we're not even close to being the number one emitter, our emissions are trending downwards and China and India's emissions are trending up, we're still about 15% of the global pie. So even if you somehow made America CO2 emissions vanish or something, that doesn't solve the problem. So curbing economic development can't be part of the solution. Constraining American emissions can't solve the problem. [48:00]

Instead, what you're looking at, is "only" the deathes of hundreds of millions of people through flooding, like horrible things that make me feel horrible to be anyone downplaying it, you could be looking at the worst catastrophe ever, and we should be doing really urgent things to avert that, but what we shouldn't be doing is giving up on human life or the idea of prosperity, because the status quo is really bad for people in poor countries. Being someplace where there's all kinds of subsistence farming and people have no electricity, that's terrible, we need to have solutions, both politically, because like it just won't work, you can sit around talk about "oh, we should have degrowth" but, like, guess what, we won't. We wouldn't have degrowth and other countries won't have degrowth and unilater degrowth wouldn't accomplish anything. [52:00]

> One regulatory perspective is that environmentalism has played a much greater role than people think. It induced a deep skepticism about anything involving the manipulation of nature or material objects in the real world. The response to environmentalism was to prohibit scientists from experimenting with stuff and only allow them to do so with bits. So computer science and finance were legal, and what they have in common is that they involve the manipulation of bits rather than stuff. They both did well in those forty years, but all the other engineering disciplines were stymied. Electric engineering, civil engineering, aeronautical, nuclear, petroleum—these were all held back, and attracted fewer talented students at university as the years went on. When people wonder why all the rocket scientists went to work on Wall Street, well, they were no longer able to build rockets. It’s some combination of an ossified, Weberian bureaucracy and the increasingly hostile regulation of technology. That’s very different from the 1950s and 1960s. There’s a powerful libertarian argument that government used to be far less intrusive, but found targeted ways to advance science and technology. https://www.the-american-interest.com/2012/02/01/a-conversation-with-peter-thiel/

> There are two ways of looking at these seemingly contradictory sets of facts. The first is that the distance between what is being done and what needs to be done is only growing...The second is that all of the relevant curves are bending — too slowly but nevertheless in the right direction.
> The change is much bigger than the turnover of American leadership. By the time the Biden presidency finds its footing in a vaccinated world, the bounds of climate possibility will have been remade. Just a half-decade ago, it was widely believed that a “business as usual” emissions path would bring the planet four or five degrees of warming — enough to make large parts of Earth effectively uninhabitable. Now, thanks to the rapid death of coal, the revolution in the price of renewable energy, and a global climate politics forged by a generational awakening, the expectation is for about three degrees. Recent pledges [Paris Agreement] could bring us closer to two.
