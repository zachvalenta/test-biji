And there’s going to be some price at which we can find a place where you’re willing to take one side and I’m willing to take the other, and let’s do that price discovery.

> people who are good at predicting things actually try to check whether or not their predictions are any good. It’s just like anything else in life. Unless you actually pay attention to what you’re doing, you won’t do it well. So how do you do that?...If you’re inclined to offer a prediction, make sure to write it down. And be really specific about what you’re predicting...give your prediction a numerical possibility...Then go back periodically to check whether the things you predicted would happen did, in fact, happen...Predictions are commonly used as one form or another of bad faith rhetorical device in punditry. People predict doom for politicians as a way of saying they don’t like them or predict failure of political tactics as a way of saying they don’t approve of them. Or they’ll issue dire prophecies of doom as a way of saying they want to get people more concerned. This encourages sloppy thinking. https://www.slowboring.com/p/predictions

* politicians don't negotiate https://betonit.substack.com/p/no-deal-how-politics-really-works
> "The Democrats will give us capital punishment if we give them abortion?! Sweet!" Normally, however, when you propose a bargain on any contentious political issue, both sides recoil in disgust.
> You could protest, "Even so, top political leaders need to get results. A big part of their job is overcoming inconvenient principles and ancient antipathies." But who says leaders desperately “need to deliver results”? Paging Carl Sagan, could you please show me the extraordinary evidence for this extraordinary claim? The standard path to political success isn’t delivering results, but straight-up demagoguery - offering poetry instead of progress.

> [on Bostrom] I have maybe a more naive, biological perspective. I see there's a history of primate species on planet earth, most of them have gone extinct, most of the ones right now are going extinct very rapidly, and we'll probably join them. My guess is that we'd be lucky to have another 1000 years left and I think it will be spent on planet earth. Now, a 1000 years would be great, but the chance that we destroy ourselves eventually, to me is quite high...but look, we've had world wars, we have weapons of mass destruction. The chance that they'll be used on a large scale is very small, but just let the clock keep ticking and write downt the distribution and the cumulative probability density function and all that and things go boom. https://josephnoelwalker.com/104-back-to-the-future-tyler-cowen/ 1:06:00
