> Some time between 1850 and 1900 or so the industrial world worked out that regulating industry is necessary, and since then we‚Äôve been arguing about how and how much, industry by industry, from industrial food to banking to airlines. Now that gets applied to tech. That‚Äôs not a great book title, but it‚Äôs probably the next decade or two. I started my career, in 1999, at an investment bank in London that had 900 people and one (1) compliance person. Today it might have 100x that. So, how many compliance people will Google have in five years? - https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/7/23/regulating-technology
* regulatory trade-off http://paulgraham.com/artistsship.html
> Consider the case of making suppliers verify their solvency. Surely that's mere prudence? But in fact it could have substantial costs. There's obviously the direct cost in time of the people on both sides who supply and check proofs of the supplier's solvency. But the real costs are the ones you never hear about: the company that would be the best supplier, but doesn't bid because they can't spare the effort to get verified. Or the company that would be the best supplier, but falls just short of the threshold for solvency‚Äîwhich will of course have been set on the high side, since there is no apparent cost of increasing it.
> In most companies software costing up to about $1000 could be bought by individual managers without any additional approvals. Above that threshold, software purchases generally had to be approved by a committee. But babysitting this process was so expensive for software vendors that it didn't make sense to charge less than $50,000. Which means if you're making something you might otherwise have charged $5000 for, you have to sell it for $50,000 instead. The purpose of the committee is presumably to ensure that the company doesn't waste money. And yet the result is that the company pays 10 times as much.
> Checks on purchases will always be expensive, because the harder it is to sell something to you, the more it has to cost. And not merely linearly, either. If you're hard enough to sell to, the people who are best at making things don't want to bother. The only people who will sell to you are companies that specialize in selling to you. Then you've sunk to a whole new level of inefficiency. Market mechanisms no longer protect you, because the good suppliers are no longer in the market.

telecoms üìô Wu, Master Switch = 19th/20th century regulatory history of communication industries
* _common carriage_: public duty of infrastructure (banking, telecom, transport, energy)
* _Mann-Elkins Act (1910)_: classified telephone, telegraph  and radio as common carriers; enforced Separation Principle "preventing the control of carriage from being used to influence parts of the information economy that the carrier does not own" [311]
* _Net Neutrality_: ISP should treat all data the same; restriction but of a non-free market (concentration of power, lack of consumer choice based on geography)
* net neutrality
> Taking a deep breath here, one genuine oddity to me of the way this conversation has played out is that the United States does not currently regulate Internet Service Providers as utilities. Or rather, a company like Comcast is regulated like a utility in its guise as a cable television provider but not in its guise as an ISP. The same is true for mobile broadband. That was a big part of the substance of the ‚Äúnet neutrality‚Äù controversy that you may recall from a few years ago. Democrats wanted internet service to be governed by a similar regulatory framework as applies to traditional telephone service. That meant a non-discrimination principle, where ISPs had to treat all bits equally, in the same way that all phone calls go through the copper and switches regardless of what the conversation is about. Democrats argued that the very limited level of competition in the market for stringing fiber optic wires to people‚Äôs houses meant this bottom level of the internet stack needed utility-style regulation. Republicans argued that allowing more flexible and creative business models would spur more investment, and that one or two ISPs per neighborhood, plus as many as four mobile providers was plenty of competition ‚Äî now down to three because Trump allowed T-Mobil and Sprint to merge. Whatever you make of this argument, I think it‚Äôs basically undeniable that wired broadband internet is a lot more ‚Äúlike a utility‚Äù than Facebook is. The idea that you would skip over the most basic, least-competitive layer of the stack and apply neutrality principles to social media companies rather than to ISPs seems crazy. https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-confused-debate-on-big-tech-and

And to some extent they can pass those costs along to consumers and workers.  The ‚Äúmaybe you can sue me, maybe you can‚Äôt‚Äù regime is more the favorite of thinly capitalized upstarts that have little to lose. So under the pure libertarian regime, big business would come running to the federal government asking for systematic regulation in return for protection against the uncertain depredations of the lower-level courts. https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2016/09/paul-krugman-gary-johnson-libertarianism-pollution.html
> If we consider regulation in general at the state and local level, should we think of that as simply a one-way ratchet that basically just goes up over time, and hardly ever goes down, and eventually gets to be too complex, too cumbersome, too restrictive? / No, I think that narrative is pretty easily falsified in the United States, as well as some other countries‚Ää‚Äî‚Äädefinitely, as a one-way ratchet. If we‚Äôre going to talk about pure monotonicity, take into account first that the degree to which we see price regulation‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich was exactly what the Chicago School and other capture theorists were so concerned about so long ago‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe‚Äôve seen a whole range of areas where the government regulates prices far less.

> At the dawn of passenger air travel, in 1938, the government established what would eventually become the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) to regulate the aviation industry as a public utility. The CAB had the power to approve new airlines, decide which airlines flew on which routes, and establish airfares.
> The minimum round-trip airfare from Los Angeles to New York in 1974 was over $1,500 in present-day dollars, a trip you can easily find for less than $300 today. 
> This meant that airlines were profitable and stable and airline employees and executives were comfortable and well paid, but it also meant that air travel was not within reach of the masses.
> When airline deregulation was first proposed in the mid-1970s, the airlines and unions opposed it, claiming that it would deteriorate the quality of American air travel. They of course foresaw that deregulation would render their route certificates worthless, and competition would reduce their collective profits and destabilize their industry.

* incentives on why police are hard to fire
> Cops are popular and elected officials generally don't want to be in huge fights with police unions, so they would like to make concessions to the police. Taxes are not popular nor is cutting Medicaid or school funding, so elected officials generally like to find concessions to make that have no obvious financial cost. The upshot is that all across the country, the tendency is for police officers to have much stronger job security than normal people as a form of non-cash compensation. This is exacerbated by the fact that financial compensation to police officers is heavily weighted toward pension benefits that accrue only after extended service. Cops who are burned out, disgruntled with the communities they serve, or lack respect for the elected officials they are nominally accountable to have strong incentives to stay on the job anyway. Because everyone is in this pension boat, officers‚Äô collective self-interest is very bound-up in nobody‚Äôs career being cut short in a way that‚Äôs not true in many other lines of work.
* 80/20 problem
> The prevalence of repeat offenders in brutality cases and special lists of unreliable officers underscores that, as is pretty much always the case with human malfeasance, a majority of the wrongdoing is being perpetrated by a minority of the people. A huge USA Today review of misconduct allegations found that ‚Äúless than 10 percent of officers in most police forces get investigated for misconduct. Yet some officers are consistently under investigation. Nearly 2,5000 have been investigated on 10 or more charges. Twenty faced 100 or more allegations yet kept their badges for years.‚Äù In terms of reducing abuse, posting ACAB on social media and advocating for arbitrary budget cuts is going to drastically underperform actually identifying the perpetrators of misconduct and purging them.
* agency problem
> It is understandable that some people will look at this catalog of dysfunction and decide they are not enthusiastic about investing public resources in these kind of institutions. But I also think it‚Äôs not a coincidence that the people most enthusiastic about defunding are young and highly educated ‚Äî i.e., people with limited lived experience of the much higher crime rate of the 1980s and 1990s and who are relatively insulated from urban violence.
* the dialogue is bad on both sides
> But it also just doesn‚Äôt really make sense as a solution to the problem. If only 10 percent of officers are generating complaints, then shrinking the force at random is going to generate a much smaller reduction in abusive behavior than specifically looking at the 10 percent and firing some of them. Unfortunately, we are currently polarized between one group of people who says ‚Äúmost officers are great cops‚Äù and then proposes either no reform or some weak implicit bias test stuff, and another group of people who say ‚Äúthe whole institutions suffer from systemic problems‚Äù and then proposes budget cuts that wouldn‚Äôt address the systemic problems. But ultimately you need to address the systemic problem, which is that it‚Äôs too hard to get rid of the bad apples.

> As with the Apple, Google, Adobe, etc., wage-fixing agreement, legal systems are sending the clear message that businesses should engage in illegal and unethical behavior since they‚Äôll end up getting fined a small fraction of what they gain. This is the opposite of the Becker-ian policy that‚Äôs applied to individuals, where sentences have gotten jacked up on the theory that, since many criminals aren‚Äôt caught, the criminals that are caught should have severe punishments applied as a deterrence mechanism. The theory is that the criminals will rationally calculate the expected sentence from a crime, and weigh that against the expected value of a crime. If, for example, the odds of being caught are 1% and we increase the expected sentence from 6 months to 50 years, criminals will calculate that the expected sentence has changed from 2 days to 6 months, thereby reducing the effective value of the crime and causing a reduction in crime. We now have decades of evidence that the theory that long sentences will deter crime is either empirically false or that the effect is very small; turns out that people who impulse commit crimes don‚Äôt deeply study sentencing guidelines before they commit crimes. Ironically, for white-collar corporate crimes where Becker‚Äôs theory might more plausibly hold, Becker‚Äôs theory isn‚Äôt applied. - https://danluu.com/cpu-bugs/#fn:S

What Goldman is appealing is a district court decision to certify the case as a class action. If you‚Äôre a company that gets sued over this stuff and you defeat class certification, you more or less win; these cases are only fun for plaintiffs‚Äô lawyers if they can sue on behalf of every shareholder who bought stock over some multi-year period. But if you lose that argument and the class is certified, the risk of the litigation gets bigger, and you more or less settle.

> Fifth, might the increased regulatory complexity happen not through literal regulations, but through fear of lawsuits? That is, might institutions add extra layers of administration and expense not because they‚Äôre forced to, but because they fear being sued if they don‚Äôt and then something goes wrong? I see this all the time in medicine. A patient goes to the hospital with a heart attack. While he‚Äôs recovering, he tells his doctor that he‚Äôs really upset about all of this. Any normal person would say ‚ÄúYou had a heart attack, of course you‚Äôre upset, get over it.‚Äù But if his doctor says this, and then a year later he commits suicide for some unrelated reason, his family can sue the doctor for ‚Äúnot picking up the warning signs‚Äù and win several million dollars. So now the doctor consults a psychiatrist, who does an hour-long evaluation, charges the insurance company $500, and determines using her immense clinical expertise that the patient is upset because he just had a heart attack. Those outside the field have no idea how much of medicine is built on this principle. People often say that the importance of lawsuits to medical cost increases is overrated because malpractice insurance doesn‚Äôt cost that much, but the situation above would never look lawsuit-related; the whole thing only works because everyone involved documents it as well-justified psychiatric consult to investigate depression. Apparently some studies suggest this isn‚Äôt happening, but all they do is survey doctors, and with all due respect all the doctors I know say the opposite.

These are the people who took the CRA, which explicitly banned discrimination based on race and sex, and interpreted it to mean that discriminating based on race and sex was mandatory through affirmative action. The doctrine of disparate impact takes it further, and often requires explicit and conscious discrimination against whites and men to ward off the possibility of even unintentional harm to women and minorities.

> The scope of U.S. federal antidiscrimination statutes that grew out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 have already made the core facts of what people think of as "Wokeness" the law of the land. This includes the concept that all disparities are due to discrimination ("disparate impact"), the requirement that employers relentlessly police private speech that could be in any way offensive to any "protected class" (to prevent a "hostile work environment"), and "affirmative action" in hiring. Moreover, the law as written is so deliberately vague in its language that any new claims to rights raised by any protected identity group can be seamlessly slipped into the body of harms that any company or organization must legally prevent. So, for example, if any employee refuses for whatever reason to refer to another employee by their chosen gender pronouns, the entire company is in real danger of being held liable for violation of Title IX and Title VII by permitting discrimination on the basis of sex (as affirmed by the Supreme Court in its Bostock decision). Or at least so the company must assume, because the potential financial penalties are far too high to risk it. The nonconforming employee is getting the boot ‚Äì unless they themselves are of a protected class that could conceivably sue for being fired due to their identity‚Ä¶ The safest path through this regulatory mess is simply to hire a very large HR department staffed with "experts" in all these rules and let them handle it, including by subjecting employees to a vast numbers of ‚Äútraining sessions‚Äù run by DEI consultants, all of which can if necessary then be pointed to in court as evidence that the company was definitely doing everything it could to prevent any discrimination from occurring. Hence why while fewer than 30% of organizations had an HR office in 1955, that number had grown to 70% by 1985, and today it is close to 100% of all firms of any significant size. So, as Christopher Caldwell has painstakingly explained, the unintended legacy of the original "emergency measures" of 1964 was to create an entire permanent apparatus of "surveillance by volunteers, litigation by lawyers, and enforcement by bureaucrats." Then "the fear of litigation privatized the suppression of disagreement, or even of speculation," and so the phenomenon of "political correctness" emerged as simply ‚Äúthe cultural effect of the basic enforcement powers of civil rights law.‚Äù But because enforcement gradually expanded through new case law and executive orders, and therefore "there was no statutory ‚Äòsmoking gun‚Äô behind it, this new system of censorship was easily mistaken for a change in the public mood." Or, as Richard Hanania has put it simply, the fact that we now have uniformly ‚ÄúWoke Institutions is Just Civil Rights Law.‚Äù https://theupheaval.substack.com/p/no-the-revolution-isnt-over

> The key thing to realize about wokeness is that it has never faced a real stress test. As I argue, its fundamental tenets have been law in the United States for over half a century. Practically every major non-religious institution in the country is forced to be conscious of race and sex, censor the speech of its employees in the name of sensitivity, act as if disparate outcomes are a sign of discrimination, and employ an internal bureaucracy to enforce these rules. Wokeness has no history of surviving without state support. In fact, even with state support, and practically unlimited rhetorical backing from elite institutions, it still struggles to win hearts and minds. Wokeness remains mostly a political loser for the left, which is why it obfuscates on issues like Critical Race Theory and the fact that civil rights law in its current form all but requires speech restrictions and racial quotas. Wokeness, unlike religion, does not appear to be able to motivate its adherents to make the extreme kinds of sacrifices that are the hallmark of true religious faith.

Justice Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor famously argued that the practice should be phased out by 2028, in an opinion defending the practice‚Äôs ongoing necessity as recently as 2003.

> Of course, rolling back civil rights law and supporting more school choice will not ‚Äúsolve‚Äù wokeness, any more than one can ‚Äúsolve‚Äù a perceived problem with conservative Islam in Afghanistan. A worldview that has captured every institution, from the federal government and health organizations to fashion magazines, is not going to be extracted from American society. There is no getting around the fact that liberals care more about politics and show higher levels of engagement. As long as this is true, institutions will respond to greater pressure coming from one side, both internal and external. What rolling back civil rights law and supporting private education can do is create alternative spaces where conservative communities and institutions can at least survive, before potentially expanding and influencing the wider culture. This might be a depressing message, but when one side controls virtually everything, survival is the best any remaining opponents can realistically hope for in the short term. Given the current state of affairs, expanding the scope of civil rights law and national service move in the opposite direction, giving government bureaucrats more of a say in private affairs and over how children spend their time. That would mean fighting wokeness on its own territory, with a greater dependence on institutions where conservatives are heavily outnumbered. https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/the-problems-with-anti-wokeness
> Criticisms of the excesses of the 1960s tend to occur at the most abstract level‚Äîblaming the Frankfurt School or ‚ÄúCultural Marxism,‚Äù while mostly ignoring American law‚Äîor simply rewriting history to pretend that civil rights was a movement that came from the political Right, having only been recently corrupted by liberals rather than one that sought equality of outcomes from the beginning. https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/the-problems-with-anti-wokeness
> More broadly, opposition to wokeness has suffered from two interrelated flaws: lack of human capital and lack of ideas. Conservative politicians and media personalities who make wokeness a defining issue for their audiences tend to be the least substantive people on the right. There is therefore a vicious cycle, in which the anti-woke are poor thinkers, so they have flawed ideas that they present in unappealing ways, which leads to a selection problem in which more individuals with bad ideas join them. https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/the-problems-with-anti-wokeness

> The Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned discrimination based on race and gender. While most at the time thought this would simply remove explicit discrimination, and many of the proponents of the bill made that promise, courts and regulators expanded the concept of ‚Äúnon-discrimination‚Äù to mean almost anything that advantages one group over another. An important watershed was the decision in Griggs v. Duke Power Co. (1971), in which the Supreme Court ruled that intelligence tests, because they were not shown to be directly related to job performance, could not be used in hiring since blacks scored lower on them, and it did not matter whether there was any intent to discriminate. People act as if ‚Äústandardized tests are racist if they show disparities‚Äù is some kind of new idea, but it‚Äôs basically been the law in the United States for 50 years, albeit inconsistently enforced.

Griggs https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1532882340510326793
> In some circles it‚Äôs common to put a lot of explanatory weight on Griggs v Duke Power in a way that I don‚Äôt think is tenable if you look internationally or at the dramatic changes in the composition of the Supreme Court over the past fifty years.
> The Supreme Court backtracked somewhat on Griggs in the 1980s, but then Congress wrote disparate impact into statutory law with the Civil Rights Act of 1991.
> Yes! Conservatives misunderstand import of disparate impact. But this is partly because legal left vanguard genuinely would like everything they don't like to be illegal.

* Executive Order 11246, Lyndon Johnson
> Across the federal government and among contractors, affirmative action assumed that "but for discrimination, statistical parity among racial and ethnic groups would be the norm."
* HR composition
> It‚Äôs not an exaggeration to say that conservative views on race and gender are often of questionable legality in the workplace.
>  The creation of bureaucracy means that it eventually gains its own power base and becomes able to advocate for its own interests. Ironically, if the US had just mandated gender and racial quotas, compliance would‚Äôve been simpler and there would‚Äôve been no need for permanent bureaucracies within each organization with an open-ended mission to stamp out all forms of ‚Äúdiscrimination.‚Äù
> The US seems to elect some of the most conservative politicians in the Western world, but has perhaps the wokest institutions. Civil rights law makes all major institutions subject to the will of left-wing bureaucrats, activists, and judges at the expense of normal citizens.
> Recent controversy over Critical Race Theory training, like the debate about whether standardized tests are racist, misses the larger point that the entire concept of a full-time bureaucracy having to micromanage people‚Äôs work lives is a creation of government.
> The ‚ÄúGreat Awokening‚Äù has been traced to the early 2010s. Since there was no major law passed at the time that coincided with the shift, people have tended to see wokeness as purely cultural. Yet by the time of the Great Awokening, the federal government had been enforcing an extreme form of anti-discrimination law for two generations. Young people have never lived in a world in which every major institution that they interacted with was not assigning them oppressor or victim status and making decisions on that basis.
> Yet the anti-woke seem unaware that the things they care about have much to do with policy. They treat every cultural outrage as an isolated event, as just another instance of elites deciding to be ‚Äúwoke,‚Äù without such decisions being connected to anything government has ever done.
* proposed solutions from Kaufmann https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2021/07/12/political-discrimination-as-civil-rights-struggle/
> Institutional autonomy is an important value, but when it collides with individual autonomy, the individual takes priority.
>  In the U.S., Republican state legislators have enacted legislation to ban ‚Äúfree-speech zones‚Äù (which restrict freedom of expression to narrowly defined areas) on campus and end schools‚Äô compulsory instruction in critical race theory, another positive start. But some are also proposing illiberal measures that inhibit college athletes from taking a knee during the national anthem or that define anti-Semitism in a more expansive way than is stipulated in law. And abolishing tenure is a threat to academic freedom and can harm vulnerable political minorities such as conservatives. A consistent approach is to ground all interventions in First Amendment and civil-rights principles.

> So the DEI industry is derived off of the rise of human resources. So you know, the way people see woke institutions today, ‚Äúwell they‚Äôre just deciding to be woke, there‚Äôs just a class of people deciding to take the leftwing issue on anything related to race and gender,‚Äù and some of that is obviously right. But you‚Äôre ignoring that basically legally you‚Äôre only allowed to be on one side of the culture wars. You‚Äôre not really allowed to say‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre a government contractor you can‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to count my employees by race or gender. I don‚Äôt want to collect that data. I don‚Äôt want to take affirmative action to help black people or women out, I believe in a colorblind policy.‚Äù Mainstream conservative views, conservatives believe this stuff, it‚Äôs not legal.
* Yang https://wesleyyang.substack.com/p/on-the-origins-of-the-emotional-support
> A network of activists, judges, and legal academics created the conceptual basis for identifying new categories of injury, all deriving their ultimate power from the landmark legislation required to dismantle legalized segregation in America. A network of trial lawyers and medical entrepreneurs found a profitable niche in colluding with a growing number of Americans regarding themselves through the prism of victimhood that happens to confer legally protected status onto them. In the process, these networks constituted themselves as an interest group.

Hanania - legal interpretation comes from institutions = get your kids out of institutions https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/governments-have-a-right-to-ban-critical
> vague standards like ‚Äúdiscrimination,‚Äù ‚Äústereotypes,‚Äù and ‚Äúdisparate impact‚Äù are everywhere in statutes and regulations, and how they get interpreted by relevant government agencies is the essence of law. Maybe in tax law or budgets you can rely on the literal words in statutes, but on hot button social issues you often can‚Äôt.
* get your kids out of public schools
> Around 12% of parents have already checked out of the public school system, and that‚Äôs while being forced to pay for government schools whether they use them or not. Taking money out of the hands of public education and putting it under the control of parents is the only way to fundamentally change what children are taught.
> When conservatives are told not to worry about big tech censorship, a popular sarcastic refrain has been ‚ÄúGo build your own Google/Twitter/Facebook!‚Äù The idea here is that it‚Äôs unrealistic to think new tech companies are going to pop up and replace those giants. But there‚Äôs nothing absurd about the idea of ‚Äúbuild your own schools.‚Äù In fact, people do it all the time; all that‚Äôs required to get more options in education is for states to create a more even playing field for public and private education to compete.
> ‚ÄúBanning Critical Race Theory‚Äù sounds like a new, vigorous, and exciting idea, while ‚Äúmore school choice‚Äù seems like the same old conservative spiel. But those who hope to change the public schools have no plan to make an overwhelmingly left-wing, and increasingly radicalized, profession reflect their preferences and values. Trust me, I like finding new and original ideas to promote, and hate to come out for such a conventional and boring suggestion like ‚Äúmore school choice,‚Äù although I at least take comfort in the fact that I took an unconventional path to get to that conclusion. Nonetheless, please try not to judge the idea based on how edgy it sounds, but based on a clear understanding of how the world actually works.

Hanania - legal interpretation of civil rights as hopelessly vague created cancel culture https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/wokeness-as-saddam-statues-the-case
> This is all the guidance you get. It‚Äôs literally based on feelings, what a ‚Äúreasonable person in the protected class‚Äù thinks is offensive, but ‚Äúsimple teasing‚Äù doesn‚Äôt count. These definitions are completely circular. When something isn‚Äôt that bad, we call it ‚Äúteasing,‚Äù when it seems bad, we call it ‚Äúhostile‚Äù; on which side of the line any particular conduct falls is for the jury or bureaucrat to decide. The entire debate over ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù revolves around what it is or isn‚Äôt reasonable to be offended about. For corporations and non-profits, this is a legal question. But although being too aggressive in rooting out ‚Äúracism‚Äù will never cost you $137 million, being not anti-racist enough might.
> Notice that that the law depends on what a typical member of the protected class thinks, not any kind of universal standard. If one race or sex is particularly sensitive ‚Äì or more importantly, if judges and bureaucrats think they are ‚Äì then this has legal significance. As polling on the word ‚ÄúLatinx‚Äù shows, educated liberals often have wrong ideas about the preferences and beliefs of groups they claim to speak for and represent. Corporations therefore aren‚Äôt required to be inoffensive to minorities or women, but to the versions of women and minorities that exist in the heads of educated liberals.
> Going back to the judge‚Äôs order, note that the ‚Äúenvironment must be both objectively offensive to a reasonable person in the protected class and subjectively offensive to the plaintiff.‚Äù In other words, you adopt working class norms and brush off racial slurs, you get nothing. Become like elites, and you just might get $137 million. With incentives like that, it‚Äôs amazing any vestige of the working class culture still exists.
> The idea that these words would have ever been grounds for a lawsuit, much less one of us becoming rich beyond our dreams, would‚Äôve never crossed anyone‚Äôs mind. I look back at that time, how cool everyone was, and compare it to how contemptibly weak most people I see talking about race in the press or academia are.
