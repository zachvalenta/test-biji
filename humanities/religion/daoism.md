## Dao De Jing

* political guidebook
* oral composition: hence repetition as feature [121]
* watersmeet of Daoism and Indian philosophy: geographical convergence (steppe running from northern China southern Siberia northern Europe) linguistic overlap (道 original pronunciation 'drog,Indo-European 'dhorg', Russian 'doroga', Czech 'draha') [132]
> I think there are a lot of known-unknowns about the linguistic situation in Europe before the incursion of the Yamnaya and the spread of the Indo-European languages that dominate the landscape today. Basque, it seems, is a last surviving outpost of a pre-Yamnaya tongue. Etruscan is an example of an ancient Old European language that we know a bit about thanks to some bilingual inscriptions. But there just really isn’t much information about whatever the languages of Old Europe were because most of these cultures didn’t write at all and even those that did didn’t leave too much behind. And even some of what they did leave behind (like the Linear A script) is indecipherable because we have no idea what language it’s supposed to be representing. https://www.slowboring.com/p/matts-mailbag-the-first-one-ever

## Road to Heaven

* _Kumarajiva_: important translator of Diamond, Lotus, Heart sutras; 350 AD 
* _Bodhiharma_: 'cut off his eyelids to keep from falling asleep while meditating; where they fell, the first tea bushes grew"
* _places_: Loukuantai, Huashan (China’s Half Dome), Gaomin Temple in Yangzhou, Big Goose Pagoda, Taipaishan, Temple of the Eight Immortals, Taipaishan (tallest in Zhongnan Mts., 1700 plants most w/ medical application)
* _themes_: making oneself light in order to more easily ascend to heaven, importance of cannabis and wine to shamanism
* _symbology_: crane (detachment, purity)
* Li Bai: mother dreamt she was impregnated by the evening star

Daoism and Buddhism

* deathless body vs. liberation from body, immortality vs. nirvana, meditation
* mutability: 'at seventeen, she had become a Taoist nun. Three years later, she switched to Buddhism'
* Buddhism originally taken as part of Daoism, with Sakyamuni as Daoist god

> we can see the cost of our desire / the loss of what we keep - Laozi

> Your eyes should see nothing. Your ears should hear nothing. Your mind should know nothing. Let your spirit take care of your body, and your body will last forever. Concentrate on the inside. Ignore the outside. Knowledge will only harm you. - Zhuangzi

> there aren’t two things in this universe

> you have to practice before you can become aware of your original nature, your original face

> our efforts to build something permanent...better to build an empty mind.

> You have to devote your whole life to your practice. This is what is meant by religion...practice takes a long time, and you have to stay healthy. If you have lots of thoughts and desires, you won’t live long enough to reach the end.

> In Zen, we keep asking who’s chanting the name of the Buddha. All we think about is where the name of the Buddha is coming from. We keep asking, until we find out who we were before we were born. This is Zen. We sit with one mind. And if the mind runs off somewhere, we follow it wherever it goes, until the mind finally becomes quiet, until there’s no Zen to Zen, no question to question, until we reach the stage where we question without questioning and without questioning we keep questioning. We keep questioning, until we finally find an answer, until delusions come to an end, until we can swallow the world, alls its river and mountains, everything, but the world can’t swallow us, until we can ride the tiger, but the tiger can’t ride us, until we find out who we really are. This is Zen.

## Short History of Chinese Philosophy - 中国哲学简史 - 冯友兰 

__老子 [6th century BC]__

* _道_: Brahman i.e. all-pervading universe
* _得_: atman i.e. individual soul also part of Brahman
* Dao as beyond: "道可道非常道" [1] "五色令人目盲，五音令人耳聋" "the five colors blind the eye, the five sounds dull the ear" [12] akin to pre-Big Bang, "has seen the beginning of all things" [21] not so much a first cause as something beyond "天下万物生于有，有生于无" [40] "老子的这句话并不意味着，从前曾有一个’无'的时期，后来从无之中跳出 有'"
* "祸莫大于不知足, 咎莫大于欲得" there is no disaster greater than not knowing contentment with what one has; there is no greater sin that having desire for acquisition" [46]
* "大道甚夷，而民好径" "The dao is very even but people follow by-ways" [53]

__杨朱 [5th century BC]__

* criticism from Confucius for sacrificing the social order to maintain personal purity (论语 - 微子, 第七节) 
* heliocentric (道家) vs. human-centric (儒家)
* corrupting influence of society ("滔滔者天下皆是也，而谁以易之” - 微子, 第六节; “the world is a swelling torrent, and is there anyone to change it?") vs. enormity of self-value (“even the honor of being Emperor could not compare [w/ the dignity of our own lives]")

__庄子 [4th century BC]__

* _importance_: solves the problem of early Daoists (how to be in a fraught world?) by dissolving the separation between individual and world [sixth chapter of the Zhuangzi]
* reinstatement of the beyond-ness of the Dao (reversing, 无名) in having-no knowledge (无知之知), a passing through from ignorance to knowledge and then beyond
