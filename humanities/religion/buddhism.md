* Maybe because I’m a lapsed Catholic, but the similarities between Catholicism and stances of some Buddhist scripture resonate. Paying off sin with material offering, detailed obsession with suffering; on the last count, however, Buddhism and its uncountable and personal hells may be even more yet. 
> for ninety one aeons he was always reborn in the womb of a whore, who always abandoned him at birth, so that the wild foxes always ate him

> When I got back I called Jude but she started to telling me about a marvelous new oriental idea in this month's Cosmopolitan called Feng Shui, which helps you get everything you want in life. [Fielding bridget jones diary 222]

Many such ritual or superstitious practices in Buddhism and non-Abrahamic religions are elided by post-WWII Western interest; the belief that, come end times, all women will be reborn as men, seems prominent. - email to Tom, 2015.10.05

* hell
> While there’s no Buddhist Inferno—the closest equivalent would probably be Wu Cheng’en’s sixteenth-century novel Journey to the West, which takes its hero, the Monkey King, to hell for all manner of torments—systematic description
> There’s a pornographic Looney Tunes quality to these descriptions that makes it impossible for me to take them seriously; they remind me of the ravings of the Westboro Baptist Church. As someone raised Christian in the West, I still reflexively associate hell with the rhetoric of original sin, collective damnation, and the Day of Judgment. The moral framework in which the Buddhist hells exist has none of these qualities. The workings of karma, which follow beings from one realm of existence to another, often result from mental and physical acts over many lifetimes; rebirth in hell is the worst of six possible categories. While there’s plenty of moralizing rhetoric in Buddhism about the power of negative karma, there’s also a healthy amount of what might be called strategic vagueness about individual cases: In the Acintita Sutta, the Buddha warns that attempts to conjecture the precise results of karma will “bring madness & vexation.”
