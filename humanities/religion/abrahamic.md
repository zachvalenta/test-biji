> Consider the example of American religion, past and present. No faith is more distinctively American than Mormonism, which (from the perspective of non-believers, at least) literally invented a fantasy-novel grade prehistory of the American continent to ground its 19th century theological narrative. But then upon that foundation, Joseph Smith and eventually Brigham Young built an actual new society, a novus ordo seclorum on the shores of the Great Salt Like, a communitarian-socialist religious utopia that worked well enough that it remains one of America’s most non-decadent micro-societies a hundred and fifty years later. Then contrast that achievement with today’s American religious virtualism, which just feels less ambitious, more content to stick with fantasy and simulation and leave reality alone. Today’s New Age gurus build impressive online brands, but not actual churches on the scale of the Mormons or the Christian Scientists in bygone days. It seems like we’re constantly told that this or that new American movement represents a “new religion” — wokeness, QAnon, wellness culture, partisan politics — but what they actually tend to represent is something thinner, something with religious energy but not the kind of real-world impact that inspires communes or monasteries or mass migrations, architectural marvels or potent works of art. And even the individual dreams and visions of our gurus seem more conformist and less eccentric than their 19th century antecedents: With Joseph Smith or the Shakers, you knew that they had a specific vision that required a fundamental and possibly insane commitment, while Deepak Chopra and Eckhart Tolle and even the great Marianne Williamson all share a fundamental theological vagueness … and I defy watchers of all the various NXIUM documentaries to distinguish Keith Raniere’s patter from a stitched-together anthology of bad self-help. https://douthat.substack.com/p/is-america-just-beginning

That I find quite American and not really found in Protestantism elsewhere or even kind of like the Jewish version of that.

> As Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, the head of the ROC, explained in early 2019, “Ukraine is not on the periphery of our church. We call Kiev ‘the mother of all Russian cities.' For us Kiev is what Jerusalem is for many. Russian Orthodoxy began there, so under no circumstances can we abandon this historical and spiritual relationship. The whole unity of our Local Church is based on these spiritual ties.” What spurred Patriarch Kirill to make that statement was the separation of much of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church from Russia in early 2019 with the creation of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, with go-ahead from the Ecumenical Patriarch in Constantinople (i.e., Istanbul: who is the not-a-pope of world Orthodoxy, where national churches are self-governing). This involved the transfer of thousands of parishes and millions of believers from the long-existing Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate, which has been under the ROC since the seventeenth century, to the brand-new OCU. The UOC-MP is self-governing under Moscow and there wasn’t much spiritual demand in Ukraine for independence from Russia, what Orthodox term autocephaly.
> Well, I thought it was just basically Catholicism without a Pope and with a more exotic liturgy, but it’s really not. And when I became a Catholic, I mean, sorry, when I became an Orthodox, somebody in our parish said: “It’s going to take you 10 years to really start thinking like an Orthodox.” And I thought that was silly. I said, “Just give me a book. Let me read it.” But Orthodoxy is something that you have to learn like you learn how to play a musical instrument. You can only really learn it through doing. And that’s something that was very hard for me to accept. I’m the sort of person that thinks I should just be able to read enough books and I’ve got something, but that is not it. It is a religion of practice. And I think in that sense, it may be closer to Judaism, as I think Judaism as a religion of practice, of thinking as well clearly, but also to be a Jew is to do things that Jews do. https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/the-lamb-of-god-who-takes-away-the-524

> Our society is the most preoccupied with victims of any that ever was. Even if it is insincere, a big show, the phenomenon has no precedent. No historical period, no society we know, has ever spoken of victims as we do. This concern sometimes is so exaggerated and in a fashion so subject to caricature that it arouses laughter, but we should guard against seeing it as only one thing, as nothing but twaddle that's always ineffective. It is more than a hypocritical comedy. Through the ages it has created a society incomparable to all the others. It is unifying the world for the first time in history. https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/the-christ-with-a-thousand-faces

> I think it’s obvious that wokeness is a Christian heritage or perversion of Christianity. René Girard wrote in one of his final books that after Christianity we have entered a place now where the sacralization of the victim per se has become a sort of a totalitarian religion.
> He sent instructions out to his agents about how to execute the Red Terror that said: "Don’t look to see what people actually said or did against Soviets. Just look at their class membership. That will tell you if they’re guilty or innocent."
> But when God died in the 18th and 19th centuries, in some sense, the utopia bill became due in this world rather than the next. The notion of making the kingdom of God manifest had to be in the here and now, not the hereafter. Most of the movements that came to characterize modernity--Marxism, classical liberalism, modern nationalism, abolitionism, the temperance movement, suffragism in its various manifestations--were born at the same time and I think it’s no coincidence.
> It’s called How Societies Remember. It’s by a British social anthropologist named Paul Connerton...what interested him was how traditional societies living in modernity managed to hold on to their traditions in the face of the dissolving currents of modernity...First of all, they had a sacred story that they held in common, the story that told them who they were. Secondly, they performed this story in ritual, in fixed rituals. The rituals had to be collective. They had to all do it together and it had to be unchanging. And the rituals had to involve the body. There’s something really important about submitting, not just your mind to these liturgies and rituals, but the body. And that really startled me when I read it. I first read it a few years ago because it helped me understand why Orthodox Christianity was so powerful and had so powerfully captured me.

> Woolridge writes about Jews because he's interested in the material success of different groups and cultures. He also looks at other oppressed minorities — particularly the Parsis, the Jains, and the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia — who have somewhat related stories of being forced into places and professions that ultimately proved lucrative. Earnest scholars (and bigots) have explored why Jews punch above their weight in various academic fields and professions. Woolridge lists all the usual reasons that typified Jewish existence over the past two thousand years: a religious requirement to be literate, a cultural adulation of education (as opposed to military heroes, beautiful people, etc.), an aversion to farming (as opposed to making a living from a trade or commerce), and more. Many scholars pin Jewish success on the fact that, in many countries, Jews were not allowed to own land. Thus restricted, Jews were forced into professions that were not land-based and required different skills. They gravitated towards cities, where the economy was not based on farming. By the time the global economy shifted away from agriculture and rural life, many Jews have already mastered relevant skills and were located in relevant urban centers — particularly in Europe and North Africa, the Middle East, and along the Silk Road. https://www.drorpoleg.com/remote-worship/
