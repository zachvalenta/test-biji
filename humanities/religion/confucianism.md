* Golden Rule 📙 Holloway 81
* Mencius https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2017/09/conservative-fairy-tales-liberal.html
>  For Mencius, politics is ultimately personal. The rise and fall of kingdoms and countries is a matter of character. But this is hardly an idea unique to the Chinese tradition. When Hamlet struts onto the stage and declares that there is “something rotten in the state of Denmark” he does not mean that the state of Denmark needs to adjust its tax rate. (Or that the Danish peasantry are being oppressed by the yoke of entrenched intersectional prejudices embedded in its structures of power!)

## 6th century - 孔子

> thought without learning is labor lost
> The Master said, "In ancient times, men learned with a view to their own improvement. Nowadays, men learn with a view to the approbation of others." http://classics.mit.edu/Confucius/analects.3.3.html

* timeline overlaps w/ Socratics
* favorable view of Zhou
* like Jesus, disciplines matter
* _concepts_: 仁 (humane) 命 (more 'conditions' than 'fate')
* _right action as self-justified_: 为而无所求 'do-for-nothing' vs. 无为
* _rectification of names_: leader to be exemplar of virtue (and thus can cease to be leadership material i.e. opens the door to revolution on moral grounds)
> 君君, 臣臣, 父父, 子子 "Let the ruler be ruler, the subject be subject; let the father be father and son be son" - 论语 XII-11 

## 5th century - 墨子

* = utilitarian, egalitarian response to Confucianism
* 兼爱 better fosters relationships leading to social harmony than Confucian 礼
* different social stratum than Confucians: ‘knights errant’ 侠 (墨家) vs. ‘literati’ 儒 (儒家) delineate social background, help account for Mohist emphasis on equality saying 有福同享有祸同当
* ok with authoritarianism: authoritarian rule actually expression of people’s will to save themselves from anarchy; suggests that while individuals may be capable of 兼爱 the people as a whole is not

## 4th century 

__孟子__

Xunzi https://scholars-stage.org/teaching-the-humanities-as-terribly-as-possible/

* tackles the why of Confucian virtue: says mankind’s goodness a function of social activity i.e. our relations enables goodness; animals social, too, but humans progress
* weighs in on Mohism
    * government as natural (Confucian) vs. useful (Mohist)
    * equality in loving others vs. gradation:  "墨氏兼愛，是無父也。無父無君，是禽獸也” / “Mo’s principle of 'all-embracing love’ amounts to making one’s father of no account; to be without a relationship of ruler and father is to be like the beasts”

__韩非子__

* 性本: human nature is evil, legal constraints can enforce order

## 3rd century - 荀子

* 性本恶心 but humans together can create virtue —> "人之性，恶；其善者，伪(人为)也"  “the nature of man is evil; his goodness is acquired training” [礼论 23] 礼 allows relationships (social, commercial) which beget culture, taking man from evil to good
