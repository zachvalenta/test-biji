> It would be pretty easy to tell a story that Amazon has 40 to 50% of e-commerce, Google and Facebook have two thirds of online advertising, most of the rest of advertising is TV and that’s all going to go to YouTube. With Apple deciding to cripple third-party advertising and cookies going away, the world is going to get very simple and very concentrated. 
> But a lot of interesting things these days point to a pendulum swinging back the other way. Shopify is 45% of the size of Amazon Marketplace and represents a tidal wave of brands going direct. Amazon has built its own ad business, that had over $30bn or revenue last year, making it bigger than YouTube (and, incidentally bigger than the global newspaper industry’s ad revenue). Amazon’s ad business is the standard-bearer for so-called ‘merchant media’, but everyone from Uber to Walmart to Instacart are following, and hiring like crazy. These are companies with structurally low margins, that realised that their digital storefronts also amounted to a lot of advertising inventory, and also realised that ad revenue that’s a small percentage of their top line has the margins to make a much bigger percentage difference to their bottom line. Amazon could already be making more cash from ads than AWS, and far more than the retail business that provides the inventory.  
> Meanwhile, Amazon, Uber or Instacart have all sorts of data that can be used for targeting, that comes with consent, doesn’t count as ‘third party tracking’, and is (probably) immune to Apple’s power plays. It’s interesting to compare this with the parallel wave of interest in dynamic advertising on smart TVs - your TV knows what you watch, and so the TV platform can insert ads into live or streaming TV, based on the viewer rather than the context. Just as with Apple’s advertising products, such a system can ’track’ you without the tracking data leaving the device. 
> TikTok, on the other hand, is an actual media company, and has built stupendous product-market fit on the consumer side, but has much less fit on the advertising side, and that’s an issue that runs across all of these companies - you have the eyeballs and the data (or at least, some kind of data), but how do you connect that into a compelling advertising product with the right metrics and ROI, and break out of experimental budgets? Indeed, people in Amazon’s business would say that they’re still only just touching the edges of the right ways to leverage what they have. 
> Looping back to Shopify, this is a SaaS company with software margins, that needs to build every possible kind of moat and network effect so that it doesn’t become commoditised. The payment platform is one piece of this, but one reason the stock has tanked is that they’ve announced they’re going to invest in physical delivery infrastructure. That would indeed be a moat against other software providers (good), but also means it competes directly with Amazon (not so good). But the other moat that it can very obviously build, of course, is advertising, where it has a lot of first party, ‘consented’ data with a lot of network effects, and where a lot of the merchants would themselves be customers.
> One more company to think about here is Spotify, which, inverting a lot of these models, has built its business using ads as a loss leader to drive subscription (you subscribe to get rid of the ads). If it inverts that model, redefines ‘podcasts’ to go after the radio market, and can produce a fundamental change in the size and relevance of its advertising (in Q4 it had 180m paying subs and 236m ad-supported MAUs, but the paying subs produced €2.3bn revenue and the ads only €400m, at a much lower GM), then advertisers would have even more choices, and even more headaches.

* advertising on Facebook
> The process is easy, cheap and effective. With a few hundred dollars and a morning’s effort, an entrepreneur can place his or her ads before social-media users that same afternoon. Companies unsure which ads are best can upload a handful of them and let Facebook’s artificial-intelligence software test their efficacy. If they don’t know who should see their ads, they can embed code on their websites that enables Facebook to monitor the traffic and then show ads to recent visitors. Or companies can send the email addresses of their existing customers to Facebook, and it will locate their Facebook accounts and put ads in front of so-called Lookalikes, users who like and click on the same things that your proven fan base does. It’s all about as straightforward as setting up an online dating profile. Steph Korey, a founder of Away, a luggage company based in New York that opened in 2015, says that when the company was starting, it made $5 for every $1 it spent on Facebook Lookalike ads. - https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/magazine/how-facebooks-oracular-algorithm-determines-the-fates-of-start-ups.html

> On Wall Street, a new hire starts as an "analyst" wielding technical expertise, but his goal is to become a dealmaker. A lawyer prides himself on professional credentials, but law firms are led by the rainmakers who bring in big clients. Even university professors, who claim authority from scholarly achievement, are envious of the self-promoters who define their fields. Academic ideas about history or English don’t just sell themselves on their intellectual merits. Even the agenda of fundamental physics and the future path of cancer research are results of persuasion. The most fundamental reason that even businesspeople underestimate the importance of sales is the systematic effort to hide it at every level of every field in a world secretly driven by it. 📙 Thiel 129
* targeted really helps small busines
> In between personal sales (salespeople obviously required) and traditional advertising (no salespeople required) there is a dead zone. Suppose you create a software service that helps convenience store owners track their inventory and manage ordering. For a product priced around $1,000, there might be no good distribution channel to reach the small businesses that might buy it. Even if you have a clear value proposition, how do you get people to hear it? Advertising would either be too broad (there’s no TV channel that only convenience store owners watch) or too inefficient (on its own, an ad in Convenience Store News probably won’t convince any owner to part with $1,000 a year). The product needs a personal sales effort, but at that price point, you simply don’t have the resources to send an actual person to talk to every prospective customer. 📙 Thiel 134

> Accounting, which looks so precise and scientific at the level of income statements, is the convergence of a long series of assumptions, many of which are audited imperfectly and rarely stress-tested. (Steve Cakebread, Salesforce's former CFO, talks about the audit process from his first accounting job, at Hewlett-Packard, part of which involved wandering around the factory floor and looking at which bins of parts were full or empty. Hewlett-Packard reported a precise number for its inventory every quarter, but that number rested on assumptions about usage, waste, obsolescence, the frequency of purchasing mistakes, and the company's ability to keep track of all of the above.) It's exceptionally hard to know what's going on at a company that employs tens of thousands of people and earns tens of billions of dollars in revenue; a CEO can talk to direct reports, but they're all promoted based on some combination of a) doing a good job, and b) appearing to do a good job, and the mix of A and B is knowable only in retrospect. Having a systematic way to keep track of everything, and to frequently visualize it, is inordinately valuable in a large and complicated company, and that's what Salesforce is selling, in many different ways. https://diff.substack.com/p/salesforce-selling

> A persistent puzzle in finance is the question of why people trade as much as they do. Most people don't reevaluate the estimated net present value of a stock on a regular basis, and most of us aren't constantly rethinking our expected future consumption baskets, loss tolerance, and other risk determinants. You can just call frequent trading irrational and leave it at that, but it's a deeply dissatisfying answer. The presence of "noise traders," whose behavior can be modeled as practically random, is a fortunate feature of markets; one way to think of them is that they pay a continuous fee to market-makers, in exchange for which market-makers allow informed traders to sometimes make money at their expense. This ecosystem works fine with stocks, because there are so many reasons to trade them, or with treasuries and FX, because there are so many parties who have to trade them. https://diff.substack.com/p/prediction-markets-and-worse-is-better

* VIE (variable interest entity) https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-07-07/owning-chinese-companies-is-complicated
> With Chinese companies this sort of thing is generally called a “variable interest entity.” You set up a company in the Cayman Islands that can be owned by anyone. The Caymans company enters into a series of contracts with the local Chinese company, giving it, not ownership, but certain carefully curated economic interests and control rights over the Chinese company. Then you list the Caymans company in the U.S., and people buy its stock, and they sort of pretend that they’re buying stock in the Chinese company — they sort of pretend that the Chinese company is a subsidiary of the Caymans holding company — even though really they’re only buying an empty shell that has certain contractual relationships with the Chinese company.
> "Ownership" of a company is a complicated notion, a vague jumble of rights to elect directors and approve mergers and claim a residual interest in the company’s cash flows. You could break those things up and sell them separately. Write a profit-sharing contract that says “A will pay B all of A’s profits after expenses for the next 100 years, renewable at B’s option,” and hey that’s a residual claim on cash flows.

> We talk occasionally about the theory that BlackRock Inc. rules the world. Not BlackRock per se, exactly, 1  but there is a small group of gigantic investment managers who are the biggest shareholders in most public companies, and who, at some level, get to tell those companies what to do. The people who run those investment managers—people like Larry Fink of BlackRock—have disproportionate power over the world.
> But it also seems wrong to think of these institutions as purely private actors with the same modest fiduciary responsibility to their investors that any small hedge fund would have. They’re a bit more than that; their size gives them power and public importance. Should it also give them more responsibilities?
> That was my rough sketch of how U.S. administrative law works, of how agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission make their decisions. They are not elected, and they do not have the same direct public accountability as a congressperson, but their processes are nonetheless designed for a certain sort of public accountability. When they make a big decision about their rules, they put out a preliminary notice of the decision and then ask interested parties, and the public, to send comments. (Sometimes with comical results.) They hold public hearings, and then, when they make the final rule, they publish a record in which they try to incorporate and respond to the public’s comments. Precisely because they are not directly elected, they try to make their decisions feel legitimate by being transparent and engaging with the public’s concerns.

> the basic problem is that index funds own every company, so they do not care about any one company in the way that traditional shareholders would, so they will sometimes vote their shares in a way that is not in the company’s specific interests. The most fun version is that index funds and quasi-indexers create an antitrust problem: If you own every company in a sector, you will not want those companies to compete against each other on price, so rising index fund ownership will lead to less competition.
> The result is that companies are mostly owned by quasi-indexers, who own the whole economy and have weird incentives when it comes to any one company, but when it comes time to vote the companies are mostly controlled by smaller and more concentrated investors, who have the time and incentive to pay attention to particular companies and vote for what’s best for them.

> So if you want money, having public stock is good. The disadvantage is that anyone can buy your stock. Activist investors can buy your stock and yell at you to change things.

When you sign a deal with a SPAC, you get cash and a public listing (like you would in an IPO), but you also get a long-term relationship with the SPAC’s sponsor. The sponsor generally joins your board of directors, typically along with a couple of other fancy people that the sponsor has signed up to be directors. For many young companies, part of the appeal of a SPAC deal is that you get a bunch of highly qualified directors all at once, directors whom you couldn’t have gotten by just going public and trying to recruit them. (If you want Shaq on your board, merging with a Shaq SPAC is the way to go.) The sponsor will tout her industry connections and financial-structuring expertise and whatever else she brings to the table; you’ll sign with her not just for the money she brings but also for the rest of the continuing relationship. https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-07-07/owning-chinese-companies-is-complicated

Dror explains https://www.drorpoleg.com/perpetual-gamma-squeeze/
> Let's assume I believe that Apple shares will increase from $170 to $200 price over the next two months. I can buy Apple shares for $170 each. Two months later, if the stock increases in value to $200, I can sell and gain $30 per share in profits. If the price goes down to $140, I can sell and lose $30 per share. If the price goes to zero, I lose the whole $170. In this scenario, I risk $170 per share in order to gain $30, or a 17.6% return.
> Alternatively, I can spend $9 on the option to buy an Apple share for $170 two months from now. If, within two months, Apple's share price increases to $200, I can exercise my option, buy the shares for $170 each, and then sell them immediately for $200. In this scenario, I will earn $30 for every Apple stock I buy, minus the $9 I paid for the option. In other words, I risk $9 and gain $21, or a 133% return.
> When people buy options, whoever sells them is taking a risk. If I sold you a contract that gives you the right to buy Apple shares at $170 at some point in the future, and Apple shares end up being worth $200 at that point, I will have to buy shares at $200 and sell them to you for $170. To hedge this risk, option sellers usually buy (or sell) stocks to offset their exposure. In the example above, the seller of an option might buy some shares at $170 to have them available if the buyer decides to exercise their option at some time in the future. In other words, the buyer of the option is causing the seller of the option to buy a proportional quantity of the option's underlying stock. This is comparable to two people or equal weight tugging at a rope. If one of them leans backward, the other one has to lean back just to remain in the same place.
> options are priced using a sophisticated formula that discourages people from buying "out-of-the-money" call options with a strike price above a stock's current market value
* _Gamma Squeeze_: 
> When the price moves up, more buyers sometimes pile onto the trade, in expectation of further increase. The option sellers are then forced to buy even more stocks to hedge their increased risk (if they sold an option to buy at $170 and the price has since moved up to $180, they have to take action just to remain "neutral"). This creates a stampede that can push a stock's price very far up, very quickly. This type of stampede is called a "Gamma Squeeze" (after the Greek letter Γ that denotes the rate of change in an option's risk sensitivity). A well-coordinated crowd can instigate a Gamma Squeeze and reap significant rewards.
* _DAO (digital autonomous org)_:
> fancy name for a simple idea: a digital "bank account" that lets multiple people pool their funds and control how these funds are spent. By "control," I mean set clear rules and ensure these rules are enforced. A DAO is essentially a piece of software that handles money. You can specify in advance that the DAO would only accept deposits from people who meet certain criteria and that the money will only be spent if, say, 65% of all DAO members agree. DAO members can also vote to hire people or give specific members the power to take certain actions.
> As critics often point out, a DAO is simply "a crowd with a bank account"

> To buy put options, you have to open an account with an options broker. The broker will then assign you a trading level. That limits the type of trade you can make based on your experience, financial resources and risk tolerance. To buy a put option, first choose the strike price. This will normally be somewhat below where the stock is currently trading. Next choose an expiration date. This could typically be from a month to a year in the future. Longer time periods generally mean less risk. Next decide how many contracts to buy. Each options contract is for 100 shares of stock. For each contract you will pay the listed premium for that option, plus brokerage fees. After paying, watch stock prices to see if it’s time to exercise the option. You can exercise the option at any time before the expiration date. If current prices fall below the strike price, the option is considered in the money. If your option is in the money, you can require the writer of the option to purchase your shares at the higher strike price. If the stock price doesn’t decline, you can let the option expire. You won’t make anything but your losses will be limited to the option costs and fees. https://smartasset.com/investing/put-option
* _call_: right to buy https://diff.substack.com/p/your-life-is-almost-a-call-option
* _synthetic_: emulation of some characteristics of another financial instrument
> A B2B business selling to healthcare providers in the United States includes an embedded synthetic call option on U.S. healthcare. Finance-to-geek translation: “If you sell to doctors you prefer futures in which more money goes to doctors. Those are much better futures for you than futures with less money going to doctors. However, even should you find yourself in a future with less money going to doctors, you will probably still have doctors to sell to, so it is difficult to imagine that future being much worse than today, given that you have only sold to a tiny percentage of all doctors so far.” - https://kalzumeus.com/2020/10/09/four-years-at-stripe/

HFT
* _frontrunning_: figuring out what you want to buy, buying it first, then selling it back to you; apparently not that big of a deal when it comes to retail investment https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-05/robinhood-gamestop-saga-pressures-payment-for-order-flow
> Third, because retail orders are generally uninformative, the wholesaler is not rubbing its hands together being like “bwahahaha now I know that Matt Levine is buying GameStop, it will definitely go up, I must buy a ton of it before he gets any!” The whole story is widely accepted but also completely transparent nonsense.
* _internalizing_:  https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-05/robinhood-gamestop-saga-pressures-payment-for-order-flow
> A million people come to a broker, half to buy half to sell, one share each. The exchange has half million shares to sell at $58.25, and orders to buy half a million shares for $58. The broker could send all of its customers’ orders to the stock exchange, where the buy orders would be filled at $58.25 and the sell orders would be filled at $58; the broker would pay the exchange a small fee for executing these orders. But! The broker realizes, look, all these people who want to buy shares could be matched up with all these people who want to sell shares. I don’t have to pay a fee to the exchange, the buyers don’t have to pay $58.25, and the sellers don’t have to get $58. The buyers could pay $58.15 and save 10 cents, the sellers could get $58.10 and make an extra 10 cents, and I could keep 5 cents (and avoid the exchange’s fee) for my trouble. This is called “internalizing”: Your broker executes your order internally, against its other orders, rather than sending it out to the exchange. In practice a typical retail broker doesn’t have the ability to do this, so it sends its orders to what is usually, in the business, called a "wholesaler" (or sometimes "internalizer"), and usually, outside of the business, called a "high-frequency trader."
> This is not actually an accurate description of the mechanics, because in fact a million orders don’t all come in at once...If the buy order can be filled at $58.15 now, the offsetting sell can probably be filled at $58.10 later, so the wholesaler can make its 5 cents. So the wholesaler executes the trades for its own account, out of inventory: If a retail sell order comes in, the wholesaler buys the shares and owns them for a little while; eventually a buy order comes in and takes the shares off the wholesaler’s hands...The wholesaler bridges the time gap between buyers and sellers. It uses its balance sheet to buy the stocks people want to sell and sell the stocks people want to buy, confident that over the course of the day those desires will mostly offset and it will make its spread.

> One inconvenience for anyone who wants to develop a general theory of profitable investing is that two of the best investors in history are Warren Buffett and George Soros. Buffett made his fortune buying cheap and selling dear (or holding forever); Soros made his by buying when things are expensive and selling when they're somehow even more so. Buffett has a theory of investing, which is obvious ("buy it for less than it's worth, and buy things that go up in value over time") but hard to implement, and has been well-described elsewhere. Soros also has a theory [Alchemy of Finance], which is non-intuitive and even harder to implement, but more broadly useful. https://www.thediff.co/p/reflexivity-in-tech-returns-talent

> In hindsight, Microsoft’s defensive moves in consumer internet did not align with its DNA. But Microsoft has deep enterprise distribution and trust, something the other FAMGA members do not. Those advantages positioned Microsoft to capture the next wave: cloud infrastructure. Azure, Microsoft’s new cloud computing operating system, quickly became an offensive move.
> If I were in charge of Microsoft’s product strategy, I’d seriously consider competing with any enterprise software company that reaches $100m in ARR. Given its lofty mission and AI-fueled vision, Microsoft may be too proud to clone simple SaaS products. But Facebook has shown that ruthless practicality in copying new startups’ products is a relatively successful strategy.

* Numerai https://mattturck.com/numerai/
> A very good interview by VC Matt Turck with Richard Craib of Numerai. Numerai runs a distributed systematic fund; data scientists create signals from data Numerai provides, but the data is stripped of all identifying information. They don't know if they're predicting the correlation between sequential changes in the relative prices of two stocks over a period of years or measuring the lag between rainfall changes and cocoa prices by the minute. There are some systematic investors who do this reality-agnostic pattern-matching view, which can help them find patterns that either don't make sense or make sense for an obscure reason. Other systematic investors will try to use strategies if there's a reason they ought to work, which restricts the range of strategies they can employ but also keeps them safe from betting that a trend will persist even when the reason for it changes. Impressively, Numerai only lost 1.5% in March of 2020, a great performance given how many trendlines and market relationships broke during that time.
