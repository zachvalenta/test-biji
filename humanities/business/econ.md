# GOODS

> Economics has historically focused on "goods" in the form of physical objects: production of food, manufacturing of widgets, buying and selling houses, and the like. Physical objects have some particular properties: they can be transferred, destroyed, bought and sold, but not copied. If one person is using a physical object, it's usually impractical for another person to use it simultaneously. Many objects are only valuable if "consumed" outright. Making ten copies of an object requires something close to ten times the resources that it takes to make one (not quite ten times, but surprisingly close, especially at larger scales). But on the internet, very different rules apply. Copying is cheap. https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/12/28/endnotes.html

* _Hotelling's law_: minimum differentiation between goods (in some markets) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotelling%27s_law https://diff.substack.com/p/longreads-open-thread-c55
* _rivalrous_: use of good prevents others from using e.g. an apple is a non-durable rival good bc eating apple prevents others use, whereas a hammer is durable rival good insofar as one can share it when done using https://stratechery.com/2020/dithering-and-the-open-web/
> Economist Paul Romer pioneered the idea that ideas themselves are non-rival. Most goods are rival. If I'm using a specific refrigerator, no one else can have it in their house at the same time. They need a second refrigerator. Ideas can be used over and over by many people at the same time. Romer postulated that the non-rivalry of ideas is the driver of per capita economic growth. Ideas become more valuable as population and economies increase in size, but they never run out. He won a Nobel Prize for his efforts. https://austinvernon.eth.link/blog/tunnels.html

> So, to summarize: in the past fifty years, education costs have doubled, college costs have dectupled, health insurance costs have dectupled, subway costs have at least dectupled, and housing costs have increased by about fifty percent. US health care costs about four times as much as equivalent health care in other First World countries; US subways cost about eight times as much as equivalent subways in other First World countries. https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/09/considerations-on-cost-disease/
> In theory, health insurance companies ought to fill the same niche, with maybe a 10% cost increase for profits and overhead. Instead we have a 1000% cost increase. Why? https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/20/the-amish-health-care-system/

prices
* price
> Price controls create shortages–that much is well known–but they also create a misallocation of goods. No doubt you have seen pictures from the 1970s of long lines of cars waiting to get gasoline. But there weren’t lineups everywhere at all times–rather we had the strange situation where there were shortage of gasoline in some places while, just a hundred miles away, there was plenty. Or shortages one day and surpluses the next. Prices rationally allocate goods across space and time in response to shifts in demand and supply. If demand increases in one place, for example, prices rise, creating an incentive to bring in supplies from elsewhere. A rising price signals where supplies are needed and creates an incentive to deliver. Or, as Tyler and I put it, A price is a signal wrapped up in an incentive. A price controlled below the market price creates a shortage and it also kills the signaling and incentive function of prices. The result is allocational chaos: Shortages in some places and times and excess supply in other places and times. https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/05/infant-formula-price-controls-and-the-misallocation-of-resources.html

> It’s certainly true that some places have higher consumption than other places, but these places also happen to also have higher production. If the desire to consume actually gave us growth, one supposes that the richest places would be those that wished for it the most. If you say no, it’s the ability to consume that gives the growth, then you’re almost there; the ability to consume is another way of saying that you have already produced value for the world (i.e., you’re a supply-sider too).
* _capacity constraint_: investment not made due to belief that current demand not yet adequate https://diff.substack.com/p/the-2x2-inflation-debate
> The simplest theoretical way to model supply and demand is through smooth, intersecting curves, but in practice the curves are choppy -- you can't build a tenth of a steel mill
* _intertemporal substitution_: waiting to do something later
> At the most basic level, intertemporal substitution means shifting an action or event to a more appropriate or advantageous time. A classic example from economics is that people will shop more when there are sales. https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-09-14/seemingly-irrational-covid-behavior-can-be-explained-by-economics
> Masking still will push infections further into the future, but if the vaccines become marginally less effective over time, as some data suggest, people may be slightly worse off later on (they’ll also be a bit older). The upshot is that the case for masking is less strong, even if you still think it is a good idea overall. Still, many people prefer to abide by fixed rules and principles. Once they learn them and lecture others about them, they are unlikely to change their minds. "Masking is good!" is a simple precept. "Exactly how good masking is depends on how much safer the near future will be!" https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/09/covid-and-intertemporal-substitution.html
> Second, the elasticity of substitution. It made sense to change behavior substantially when the vaccines were coming. But the vaccines have been here for some time, they are great, they work.

> But I think we know that financial markets do not adequately insure against low-probability, high-severity risks. That’s true of truly existential risks, but also just of any kind of low-probability events. You can’t get insurance against massive disruption of the semiconductor industry. So then there’s no investment in the hedge against that, and we need governments to reduce downside tail risk. It is worth some short-term efficiency loss to do that. https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/matthew-yglesias-pundits-fallacy-military-intervention/

> One of the more fundamental problems is that crypto assets can be either useful hedges, or useful forms of payment — but not easily both. That is why stablecoins, such as crypto assets pegged to the dollar, have proven of enduring interest. People want to transfer something dollar-denominated but with crypto-like features. Yet the very stability of these coins means they have to create institutional layers to preserve their value. For the foreseeable future, the institutions building dollar-linked stablecoins will be riskier, less transparent and more difficult to deal with than the dollar-based system itself, including the surrounding banks...Second, to the extent stablecoins and other crypto assets become a major part of the financial system, they will attract more regulatory interest. That in turn will limit many of their advantages over the traditional bank sector. The U.S. government does not want a financial system that evolves outside the purview of the Federal Reserve, FDIC and other regulatory institutions. Third, the formal banking sector will improve, for instance by moving to more rapid clearing, or by introducing electronic reserve currencies. With the latter, you could transfer your electronically-based dollars within the accounting system of the central bank, and achieve a non-intermediated transfer without resorting to crypto. It is not obvious that crypto will be the market winner once more mainstream institutions learn some lessons from the success of crypto. Imagine that virtual reality takes off, and there are economies inside virtual reality, spanning many nations. A crypto asset might be a more convenient means of payment within those networks than the dollar, if only because of the cumbersome reporting requirements for larger dollar transfers. Still, the motive for using that same crypto asset to purchase your next Toyota, or to borrow from your bank to start a restaurant, is less than clear. https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-12-29/bitcoin-hits-new-high-but-cryptocurrency-s-future-is-uncertain https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/01/austin-vernon-on-crypto-from-my-email.html

* _deficit_: spend more than you take in during a year https://datalab.usaspending.gov/americas-finance-guide/
* _surplus_: bring in more than you spent during a year
* _debt_: total amount owed; typically measured as a percentage of GDP; in the case of the US has typically been around 50% but went to 100% post-2008 https://youtu.be/tpMsBi47k8Q when things are bad you won't even be able to service the interest
* _Tiebout competition_: cities must compete against each other https://www.econlib.org/why-are-there-zero-republican-mega-cities/ https://betonit.substack.com/p/no-retirees-in-my-backyard
> But I actually do think there’s a sense in which local government is kind of like a business. A local government, for starters, is financially constrained — it can’t just run big open-ended deficits. And local governments need to compete with other localities for tax base. And most of all, local governments mostly spend money on the direct provision of services in a way that creates feedback to the tax base...There’s an idea called Tiebout Competition, which holds that for exactly this reason, different localities will compete against each other to offer the optimal combination of tax rates and service levels. https://www.slowboring.com/p/new-yang-city
> Now it turns out that to actually compare different American cities’ tax situations is very challenging because American cities differ considerably in their basic functions — Los Angeles and Chicago are inside their respective counties, while Philadelphia and Jacksonville are counties, New York encompasses five counties, and Columbus encompasses parts of three different counties.

programs
* _universal_: available on non-income basis e.g. Medicare, Social Security, public library https://www.slowboring.com/p/means-test
> The idea here is that the case for universal programs is fundamentally political. They are more popular and therefore more sustainable, and the participation of non-poor people in the program mean elected officials actually pay attention to the quality of the service — libraries are nicer than homeless shelters because middle class people use them and care about how nice they are.
> Social Security and Medicare are the paradigmatic universal programs, but some people die before becoming eligible. Public schools are available to all children, but not every family has children. I think the best way to think about these programs is that eligibility for them is categorical — it applies to broad swathes of people based on easily defined characteristics — which facilitates low administrative burdens.
> And while Social Security isn’t strictly “for” low-income people, it does have the happy consequence of creating a situation where the poverty rate for the elderly is lower than the overall national poverty rate https://www.slowboring.com/p/mitt-romneys-child-allowance-plan

> In practice, outside of a few cities you rarely see an affluent person riding the bus in the United States. But to exclude the rich from the bus would require that everyone provide income verification before boarding, which would be a huge pain.
> It’s sort of useful to benchmark public services in terms of “do politically empowered middle-class people find this usable?” If your library is so crappy that only the most destitute people actually use it, then you are providing the poor with a really bad library. If your library is popular with users from all walks of life, then that means you have a good library.
> The reality is that most government entitlements are middle-class in nature: social security, Medicare, a lot of the education pieces.

> The big problem is that with a targeted program, you really kind of do need to choose between inclusion errors and exclusion errors, and given the politically explosive nature of benefits fraud, there are strong incentives to under-enroll people.

> Reaching a political consensus on “a better way to spend the money” takes years, decades, or eternity.  Refusing to cut wasteful spending until we agree on the right way to reallocate is therefore a great way to keep wasting money for years, decades, or eternity.

🔗 https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/

* https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-welfare-state-is-extremely-good
> But it did achieve its political objective of opening up space for two other kinds of programs. On the one hand, you have cash assistance programs that are tied to work (Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit). On the other hand, you have programs — Medicaid, SNAP, Section 8 housing vouchers — that don’t require work but also don’t give you cash. There’s also TANF, which is a federal program that gives grants to states to help them organize a cash welfare system whose benefits are only temporary (that’s what the T stands for) and conditioned on finding work within two years. The states are given huge discretion on how to run this program, often using the money for things other than delivering cash benefits. Then America also has a separate, much more generous welfare state for senior citizens — Social Security and Medicare — and there seems to be a social consensus that the elderly are deserving of help.
> The big problem with this patchwork of programs is that it’s so much a patchwork. Eligibility rules and procedures vary by state. If you move, you might lose benefits which creates a significant disincentive to relocate even when doing so might have other major benefits...Social Security, by contrast, is really convenient.

Austin Vernon https://austinvernon.site/blog/ruralfuture.html
> Most of the corn and soybeans that are grown are not human-edible...The demand for animal protein drives demand for farmland.
* _plow_: get rid of weeds but damages topoil, necessitating fertilizer
* _rotational grazing_: force ruminants (cows, sheep) to graze in single enclosure until they've eaten all grass species and moved around to break up the soil with their hooves and fertilize the soil with waste; done bc otherwise they just eat their favorite grasses, which worsens soil (greater grass diversity = healthier soil)
* _CAFO_: concentrated animal feeding operations = chickens that don't have anywhere to stand
* demand inelastic = greater productivity deflationary 
> The demand for farm products is inelastic. Inelastic demand means even sizable changes in price have little impact on demand. A human stomach is only so big! If food prices go down, most people buy other things rather than stuff more food down their gullets. Prices must decrease significantly to match supply and demand after productivity increases. Even with an increased global population, increased grain demand from meat consumption, and government programs, land under cultivation has decreased in the US.
* meat and dairy alternatives = lower demand for agricultural land
> Making proteins with yeast is incredibly efficient. Scientists and engineers have spent decades producing yeast strains that require few resources to stay alive. Compare this to a cow that has to maintain thousands of pounds of living mass and walk around. Perfect Day is a startup that uses yeast to make milk proteins. Instead of feeding sugar to cows (corn and grass), the yeast eats sugar in a big tank. The yeast turns the sugar into dairy proteins identical to what cows produce.
* lower demand for agricultural land + remote work + better transportation = higher demand for rural land, smaller parcel sizes
> Shrinking demand for traditional crops, aging farmers, and improving connections to cities mean land usage will change. Hobby farms, remote workers, and artisanal farms will slowly grow at the expense of traditional agriculture.

classical vs. neoclassical https://www.slowboring.com/p/human-history-in-the-very-long-run https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-domestication-of-people-and-animals
> In neoclassical economics, we have two factors of production — capital goods and labor. The original classical economists were wiser and had a third factor — land. Hunter-gatherers didn’t have a lot of capital, so for them, land and labor were the key factors. If you were someplace where there’s fruit, you could get yourself some fruit by deploying a little gathering labor. Similarly, if there’s meat, you could get some meat by deploying some hunting labor. But because you get the non-metaphorical low-hanging fruit first, your gathering labor has sharply diminishing marginal returns. If you hunt, you kill some animals and scare the others off. The land itself is just not very productive, which is why you’re living in nomadic bands. But the non-productivity of the land also means that you only need to work so hard because there’s really no point in putting in more hours. For analog-era journalists, the number of column-inches of copy the editors would print was constrained by the number of ads that were sold — there just wasn’t that much demand for content. On the internet, there’s no objective limit on the number of articles you can afford to run, so there is a lot of pressure to publish at high volume. Nomads work hard — up to a point — but then they stop.
> This is Scott’s point about grain specifically: because it’s harvested at a specific time and then dried and stored, it’s ideal for stealing. You could show up at somebody’s radish field and dig up their radishes, but then you’re actually doing some of the work of running a radish farm. But you can cart off a ton of rice or barley or millet or corn and make a nice living as a bandit. Or you could become one of Mancur Olson’s “stationary bandits” who decides to start calling the stealing “taxes.” Or maybe the village organizes a squad of trained and equipped fighters to stop bandits from stealing your stuff, but then it turns out you’re paying protection money to the fighter class. Either way, in addition to people working harder than before, there’s this new class of people who don’t grow the food and just take stuff. To the extent that there’s a virtue to the agricultural revolution, this is it: By making the land much more productive, you allow the aggregate size of the human population to become much larger. By turning most people into sedentary sitting ducks, you allow the creation of a surplus-extracting exploiter class who are much richer than the richest hunter-gatherer. When I first read Derek Parfit’s “Reasons and Persons,” I viewed the “repugnant conclusion” thought-experiment about shifting society to one with a much larger population at considerably lower standards of living to be interesting but also a kind of weird hypothetical. But one of the signature developments of our history really did have that character — pushing the median living standard down considerably but raising the number of people dramatically.

> Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan also shook up land ownership around this time, but mostly by breaking up large estates and giving individual farmers ownership of their plots. As it turns out, these smaller farms were far more productive than huge ones; many of the big efficiency gains from modern agriculture simply weren't available, whereas the efficiency gain from aligned incentives was. China, weirdly enough, launched an agricultural reform in reverse, consolidating small plots into giant state-owned farms, with the attendant drop in labor efficiency. https://diff.substack.com/p/a-normal-country

> From the earliest times of which we have record – back, say, to two thousand years before Christ – down to the beginning of the eighteenth century, there was no very great change in the standard of life of the average man living in the civilised centres of the earth. Ups and downs certainly. Visitations of plague, famine, and war. Golden intervals. But no progressive, violent change.
> This slow rate of progress, or lack of progress, was due to two reasons – to the remarkable absence of important technical improvements and to the failure of capital to accumulate.
> The modern age opened; I think, with the accumulation of capital which began in the sixteenth century. I believe – for reasons with which I must not encumber the present argument – that this was initially due to the rise of prices, and the profits to which that led, which resulted from the treasure of gold and silver which Spain brought from the New World into the Old. From that time until to-day the power of accumulation by compound interest, which seems to have been sleeping for many generations, was re-born and renewed its strength. And the power of compound interest over two hundred years is such as to stagger the imagination.

* Industrial Revolution caused by high wages in Britain
> Here the book finally feels comfortable making a strong claim: the Industrial Revolution started in Britain because of its high wages. Other countries had some of the same scientific acumen and proto-technology, but only in Britain was it worth actually building machinery; everywhere else it was cheaper just to hire more laborers (or buy more slaves). The beginning of industrialization caused a positive feedback loop; the new machines raised wages (since workers were more productive), creating even more demand for even more machines. Britain became a center of machine-making expertise (the fact that it was full of giant coal and iron deposits didn't hurt), and the rest is history. Soon the world was flooded with cheap British goods, and everywhere else's manufacturing industries collapsed. In 1600, India, the Middle East, and Africa all had their native traditions of manufacturing. These might not have been giant factories, but people were making textiles, iron, tools, weapons, etc at various levels of sophistication. They all disappeared as Britain outcompeted them: "In Bihar [India], the share of the work force in manufacturing dropped from 22% around 1810 to 9% in 1901."
* institutions still matter
> For example, why did settler colonies (eg Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa) converge to British levels of development so quickly? The book doesn't answer this, and as far as I can tell its thesis predicts this wouldn’t happen. How come all of the mid-20th-century success stories are in East Asia and not somewhere else? As far as I can tell, GEH:VSI would have to call this coincidence. Maybe it shouldn't have thrown culture out so quickly?

* can't stimulus an economy out of secular stagnation, need population growth https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-economic-case-for-pro-natalism
> The way this works is that when the population growth rate is low, the current market demand for long-lasting physical investments (buildings, basically) is also low. That makes interest rates very low. Low interest rates have some attractive properties, but one thing that happens in a low-rate environment is that you’re constantly bumping up against the limits of central banks’ ability to stimulate the economy with interest rate cuts. You either need to do more exotic monetary policy actions, or else you need fiscal stimulus. Krugman’s answer is we shouldn’t worry too much about this as an economic problem because we can always just fix it by doing the fiscal stimulus. But here’s the problem. For a country with a flat or declining population to do what Japan does and pour tons of money into transportation infrastructure projects is awfully wasteful. The conditions that make market demand for private capital low also make the value of public capital low. And indeed we see this in the United States, where the surface transportation funding formula ensures that they keep doing highway expansion projects in Rust Belt states with no population growth, and aside from the direct job creation impact of building the roads, it doesn’t do anything to promote community revival. Here’s an idea, though — what if instead of doing infrastructure projects with our fiscal stimulus, we invested money in parents and children?
> Large populations lend themselves to specialization in lots of other useful ways. But the particular form of specialization that lets people be researchers or work on developing practical applications for the research of others has particularly large benefits. Now obviously it’s a little simplistic to say “if we had twice as many people, we’d have twice as much innovation.” Life is more complicated than that. But it’s not really that much more complicated. Progress relies on the efforts of singular individuals who move things forward.
> What secular stagnation directs attention to is the question of how an economy absorbs saving. In the American context, or the industrial-world context at large, secular stagnation is basically a concern that private saving is excessive relative to the demand for private investment, even at very low interest rates. As a consequence, you have very low interest rates, shortfalls in demand, and a tendency to asset bubbles because those saving flow into existing assets. The way that has manifested itself in China over time, which has an extraordinary savings rate, is increased pressure to absorb all of that saving. And that pressure to absorb saving has a central economic problem, which is what defined secular stagnation, has defined two aspects of the Chinese experience over time: it has defined the enormous emphasis on public investment and infrastructure investment. It’s basically the avoidance of secular stagnation that explains why in four years of the previous decade, China laid more concrete than the United States did in the entirety of the 20th century. So the first way in which secular stagnation theory explains Chinese performance is it points to those very high levels of public investment. It also explains the pattern of China’s international accounts. One might normally expect that a country that had tremendous growth prospects, that was industrializing extremely rapidly, that was seeing vast labor exit from rural agriculture, would be a country that would be importing capital on a substantial scale. But the level of saving in China is so great that it actually has been exporting capital on a substantial scale, particularly up to the last several years. https://chinatalk.substack.com/p/larry-summers-on-china

Taiwan has existed in the shadow of communist China for about as long, and while the country started out much poorer than the US, it’s now a prosperous place, leads the world in some areas, and hasn’t been conquered yet.

> While it admits that they [property rights] matter to some degree, it also points out that some of the most successfully-developing economies, including Britain in the 1700s and Japan in the Meiji period, had unusually strong governments, high taxes, and poor property rights. The strong governments pursued strong industrial policies, the high taxes paid for infrastructure, and the poor property rights let governments use eminent domain to build canals, railroads, et cetera. In other cases, the book just isn't sure these helped that much. For example, China gets a lot of credit for its free-market reforms under Deng Xiaoping, but these reforms just took China from "literally Mao" to "kind of an average level of market freedom for developing countries". Given that the average developing country has an average-for-developing-countries level of market freedom, but does not experience a China-level economic miracle, these can gain only partial credit for China's success.
> By 1800, we're already starting to see the developed/undeveloped country gap we know today. The 1800s version of the gap was: Britain was developed, everyone else was undeveloped. Various Western countries noticed this and invented what Allen calls the Standard Development Model. This was the first time anyone had ever tried to do development economics or answer the question "How do countries industrialize and how can we do it faster?" -> Create a large internal market by abolishing [internal] tariffs and improving transportation. Erect an external tariff to protect 'infant industries' from British competition. Create banks to stabilize the currency and provide businesses with capital. Establish mass education to speed the adoption and invention of technology.
> having a pretty heavily planned economy while you're playing catch-up, and then unwin
> If you're 2000s Bangladesh trying to catch up to the West, you want semiconductor factories. Scrounging around a mostly-agrarian economy and eventually cobbling together enough expertise and capital to make a textile mill is one thing. Making a semiconductor factory is a lot harder. And if you decide to just make the textile mill instead, what if First World textile mills are some sort of amazing robotic wonderland now and nobody wants your crappy 1800s-technology textiles?

> What Germans did with money between 2003 and 2008 would never have been possible within Germany, as there was no one to take the other side of the many deals they did which made no sense. They lost massive sums, in everything they touched. Indeed, one view of the European debt crisis—the Greek street view—is that it is an elaborate attempt by the German government on behalf of its banks to get their money back without calling attention to what they are up to. The German government gives money to the European Union rescue fund so that it can give money to the Irish government so that the Irish government can give money to Irish banks so the Irish banks can repay their loans to the German banks.

> And economists tend to irritate other academics. Because economists have way better outside employment opportunities than other social science PhDs, economics programs have come to attract higher quality applicants, and today, economists have higher GRE scores than other disciplines. These departments are full of smart people using moderately difficult math to tackle all kinds of interesting questions like “Do patients adhere more or less to official medical advice if they have doctors in the family?” (less) or “How effective are DNA databases at deterring crime?” (very). Since economists no longer accept conceptual boundaries as to what constitutes an economics question, they end up intruding into other fields’ areas of specialization and often do so with little humility or respect for existing literature. Amory Gethin, Clara Martínez-Toledano, and Thomas Piketty recently published a good paper surveying education polarization across 21 western democracies that exhibits zero evidence they are aware political scientists have been covering this for a while.

> The Jackie Robinson example would seem to cut in Caplan's favor. After all, Jackie Robinson did break the color barrier *without government regulation*, and the reason was the one that Caplan would cite, i.e., competitive pressures faced by the Dodgers. Of course, one can point out that MLB did not hire Black players before Robinson but, ultimately, MLB did beat government to the punch. So, Robinson would be a counter-example to Tenet #6. Government regulation does not necessarily lead to less discrimination as government often has *less* incentive to combat discrimination than do for-profit firms. Indeed, many government regulations have been enacted to perpetuate discrimination, e.g., Jim Crow and minimum wage laws. So, one can't conclude that without government regulation, discrimination would still be more rampant. Caplan's critique actually makes claims that go beyond merely disproving Tenet #6, however. He makes a blanket statement that market forces generally make discrimination a "marginal issue at most". Clearly, MLB's pre-Robinson era contradicts that. Market forces may combat discrimination more effectively than government regulation, contra Tenet #6, but that doesn't mean that market forces and government regulation can't *both* fail to combat discrimination.
> When the positives of talent outweighs of the costs of diversity private actors embrace diversity. When sports was fundamentally amateurish nobody really cared about the performance advantages of recruiting black athletes, but as the reward for on the field performance increased eventually someone picked up the $20 bill. High IQ wasn't that advantageous for being an elite before the modern era, but by the 1920s IQ was obviously an important component of being a successful elite. Female labor became more valuable as mortality rates fell, less time was spent pregnant or caring for children, most domestic labor was replaced by machines, and returns for mental skills over physical skills increased. So in all of these cases the presence of earlier discrimination was mostly just a result of underlying economics. When the economics changed, the norms changed relatively quickly in the grand scheme of things.

Studies that don’t control for test score differences but examine earnings gaps within specific professions—lawyers, physicians, nurses, engineers, scientists—tend to find Black workers earn zero to 10 percent less than white workers. These gaps could reflect discrimination, unmeasured skill differences, or other factors such as geography. In any case, such gaps are small compared to the 50 percent overall Black-white earnings gap and reinforce the idea that closing skills gaps would go a long way toward closing income gaps.

automation != taking all the jobs, automation = reducing number of good jobs https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/business/economy/productivity-inequality-wages.html

> Despite all its shiny new high-tech businesses, the vast majority of new jobs are in workaday service industries, like health care, hospitality, retail and building services, where pay is mediocre.

> Because it pushes workers to the less productive parts of the economy, automation also helps explain one of the economy’s thorniest paradoxes: Despite the spread of information technology, robots and artificial intelligence breakthroughs, overall productivity growth remains sluggish.

> To find the bulk of jobs in Phoenix, you have to look on the other side of the economy: where productivity is low. 

> While Banner invests heavily in technology, the machines do not generally reduce demand for workers. “There are not huge opportunities to increase productivity, but technology has a significant impact on quality,”

> The 58 most productive industries in Phoenix — where productivity ranges from $210,000 to $30 million per worker, according to Mr. Muro’s and Mr. Whiton’s analysis — employed only 162,000 people in 2017, 14,000 more than in 2010. Employment in the 58 industries with the lowest productivity, where it tops out at $65,000 per worker, grew 10 times as much over the period, to 673,000.

> The same is true across the national economy. Jobs grow in health care, social assistance, accommodation, food services, building administration and waste services. Not only are some of the tasks tough to automate, employers have little financial incentive to replace low-wage workers with machines.

> Economists have a hard time getting their heads around this. Steeped in the belief that technology inevitably leads to better jobs and higher pay, they long resisted the notion that the Luddites of the 19th century, who famously thrashed the weaving machines that were taking their jobs, might have had a point.

> “In the standard economic canon, the proposition that you can increase productivity and harm labor is bunkum,” Mr. Acemoglu said.

> By reducing prices and improving quality, technology was expected to raise demand, which would require more jobs. What’s more, economists thought, more productive workers would have higher incomes. This would create demand for new, unheard-of things that somebody would have to make.

> Weavers lost their jobs to automated looms; secretaries lost their jobs to Microsoft Windows. But each new spin of the technological wheel, from plastic toys to televisions to computers, yielded higher incomes for workers and more sophisticated products and services for them to buy.

> The growing awareness of robots’ impact on the working class raises anew a very old question: Could automation go too far? Mr. Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University argue that businesses are not even reaping large rewards for the money they are spending to replace their workers with machines.

> The relationships between unions and unionized companies can even be symbiotic, because unions will exert political pressure to protect their hosts. According to Michael Lind, when politicians tried to attack the A&P supermarket chain because it was putting local grocery stores out of business, "A&P successfully defended itself by allowing the unionization of its workforce in 1938, thereby gaining organized labor as a constituency." I've seen this phenomenon myself: hotel unions are responsible for more of the political pressure against Airbnb than hotel companies.
> As big companies' oligopolies became less secure, they were less able to pass costs on to customers and thus less willing to overpay for labor. And as the Duplo world of a few big blocks fragmented into many companies of different sizes — some of them overseas — it became harder for unions to enforce their monopolies. As a result workers' wages also tended toward market price. Which (inevitably, if unions had been doing their job) tended to be lower.

* German vocational education
> I don’t know anything about Swiss education, but I have a longstanding half-assed take on German vocational education that is perfect for a Q&A forum: everyone in America likes to praise Germany and their apprenticeships, but you have to understand how different the institutional context is. The reason German vocational education works is that it’s clearly not just warehousing of disfavored students. Real employers are very involved with it, so the training is genuinely useful. But in America, having community colleges or high schools working hand-in-glove with big companies to provide them with tailored, subsidized job training would be very controversial. Competitors would see it as unfair. People would worry that it’s undermining the wages of the existing workforce. In the German context, they are more comfortable with the state working hand-in-glove with private businesses because they also have a very different labor relations model. The country has a small number of very large labor unions that engage in “sectoral bargaining” with all employers in a given economic area. And there is a system of “codetermination” in which workers’ councils elect members of corporations’ supervisory boards. So the apprenticeships and vocational education operate in a paradigm of strong worker voice and an entrenched culture of labor-management cooperation that’s totally different from what we have in the United States. Long story short, I think there’s a lot that’s attractive about German vocational education, but I don’t think you could just transplant it to the United States on a nationwide basis. Now that said, if a particular city decided that it was comfortable being a “company town,” it could work — like Seattle Public Schools could decide to partner with Amazon to create a program to train high school students to do mid-skill logistics work. But my suspicion is that it wouldn’t go over well; American voters expect to see more of an arm’s length relationship between corporations and the government. https://www.slowboring.com/p/matts-mailbag-the-first-one-ever

B2B software companies’ success scales with both the count of their users and those users’ success, because their pricing model will generally (unlike most B2C companies) capture a portion of the customer’s upside. They have the same incentives in growth that B2C companies do, but they have an additional lever: making the user more successful directly incrementally helps them.

> Even more striking are the number of officially sanctioned projects that manage to do all eight things wrong. In fact, if you look at the way software gets written in most organizations, it's almost as if they were deliberately trying to do things wrong. In a sense, they are. One of the defining qualities of organizations since there have been such a thing is to treat individuals as interchangeable parts. This works well for more parallelizable tasks, like fighting wars. For most of history a well-drilled army of professional soldiers could be counted on to beat an army of individual warriors, no matter how valorous. But having ideas is not very parallelizable. And that's what programs are: ideas. - http://paulgraham.com/head.html 

> It's not merely true that organizations dislike the idea of depending on individual genius, it's a tautology. It's part of the definition of an organization not to. Of our current concept of an organization, at least.

Arguably a market is such a form of organization, though it may be more accurate to describe a market as a degenerate case—as what you get by default when organization isn't possible.

Dror on Coase https://austinvernon.eth.link/blog/softwareisprocess.html
> As Ronald Coase pointed out in 1937, a corporation is like a centrally-planned economy...resources allocated based on executive decisions (as opposed to the invisible hand and processing mechanisms of the free market). If free markets are so efficient, why do corporations exist? Coase pointed out that it would take too long for companies to find, contract, and train/adapt the right person or resource each time they wanted something done. As a result, it is often more efficient for a corporation to "own" 100% of some people’s time, even if a lot of that time is wasted and many tasks could be done better by someone else.

> One reason to love it is as a story about the Coase theorem. The Coase theorem says that if a timberland owner can make $15 by cutting down her trees, but cutting her trees would cause $20 worth of harm to her next-door neighbor — because the neighbor would miss the view, or the cooling shade of the trees, or the carbon capture — then they should be able to strike a bargain. The neighbor can pay the landowner $17 not to cut the trees; then the landowner is $2 better off than if she had cut the trees (she has $17 instead of $15), and the neighbor is $3 better off (she loses $17 instead of $20). The outcome — not cutting the trees — will be the socially optimal outcome, the one that maximizes overall well-being, rather than the property owner’s simplistically selfish outcome. If, that is, there are low transaction costs. The Coase theorem is really about transaction costs. In the stylized example of one landowner and one neighbor, you can imagine them easily striking a deal. But what if the landowner can make $15 by cutting the trees, and there are 10 neighbors who would each suffer $2 worth of harm? It might be harder to get them all to coordinate to pay the landowner not to cut the trees; some of them might be hard to reach, or suspicious, or try to free-ride on the others. The limit case of this is of course global environmental harm, where the landowner makes $15 by cutting the trees but eight billion people suffer an infinitesimal but real harm for every bit of extra carbon in the atmosphere. That is a very hard problem from a Coasean transaction-costs perspective. https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-21/you-can-sell-the-trees-you-don-t-cut

* supplier networks require lower transaction costs i.e. computers
> Why didn't Henry Ford realize that networks of cooperating companies work better than a single big company? One reason is that supplier networks take a while to evolve.

And the second reason is that if you want to solve a problem using a network of cooperating companies, you have to be able to coordinate their efforts, and you can do that much better with computers. Computers reduce the transaction costs that Coase argued are the raison d'etre of corporations. That is a fundamental change.In the early 20th century, big companies were synonymous with efficiency. In the late 20th century they were synonymous with inefficiency.

> COWEN: Why aren’t insurers better at bargaining down healthcare costs, including with hospitals? EMANUEL: Many reasons. One reason is, they typically make money on the percentage of transactions they do, so that’s an incentive to actually increase costs. Second, they typically have a small market share in any particular region, and that undermines their bargaining power in that region. Third, a lot of employers want different kinds of benefit packages, and that actually, again, undermines their ability to negotiate hard. Most big employers want to satisfy their workers. You know, human resource departments, their number-one obligation is typically not to keep healthcare costs down but to keep kvetching down, keep down the complaints of workers. The easiest way to do that is have a wide network of hospitals, wide network of doctors. That drives costs up and handcuffs the insurer in terms of their negotiating power. Nonetheless, I think they could do better than they are doing, and I do think, over the next few years, you’re going to see them do better. One major reason is that employers have said, basically, “Enough is enough. Now, cost is at our limit, and we want you to be better about cost control.” I think that’s risen to number one, as opposed to just rhetorically number one. I think, actually, it’s risen pretty much to number one. https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/ezekiel-emanuel/

> Lots of Americans get an insurance plan from their employer, and then consume health services in a price-insensitive way, knowing very well that their insurance will pay for it. Sometimes they will briefly be limited by deductibles or out-of-pocket charges, but after these are used up, they’ll go crazy. You wouldn’t believe how many patients I see who say things like “I’ve covered my deductible for the year, so you might as well give me the most expensive thing you’ve got”, or “I’m actually feeling fine, but let’s have another appointment next week because I like talking to you and my out-of-pocket charges are low.”
> Meanwhile, back in the modern world, I’ve written before about how a pharma company took clonidine, a workhorse older drug that costs $4.84 a month, transformed it into Lucemyra, a basically identical drug that costs $1,974.78 a month, then created a rebate plan so that patients wouldn’t have to pay any extra out-of-pocket. Then they told patients to ask their doctors for Lucemyra because it was newer and cooler. Patients sometimes went along with this, being indifferent between spending $4 of someone else’s money or $2000 of someone else’s money.
> But the healthcare system is a very salient middle-class example. Providing healthcare primarily through employers means that maintaining continuous coverage requires an annual modest hassle around re-enrollment and a larger set of paperwork every time you switch jobs. The upside you get for this is lower taxes. Instead of paying a Value Added Tax that would raise the cost of all the goods and services we buy, non-poor Americans accept lower salaries (because employers are subsidizing our health insurance), lower take-home pay (because we’re paying premiums), and higher out of pocket costs. But we also have to do all this paperwork. It strikes me as a bad trade, all things considered. https://www.slowboring.com/p/means-test-when

* _job lock_: reluctance to leave job bc tie to insurance
> The health insurance problem in America boils down to two issues: There are 28.9 million uninsured people. Nobody should be uninsured. A huge amount of the people who are insured are insured poorly and almost everyone who is insured is insured through their employer. Employers mostly shouldn’t handle health insurance, and health insurance should not be so insufficient for so many.
> When uninsured people do have emergencies, they are charged huge amounts for their emergency care. In most cases, they’re not going to be able to pay this amount. When patients can’t pay, they fall into medical debt, which affects 137 million Americans. Two-thirds of people who file for bankruptcy cite medical issues as a key contributor
> Tying health insurance to your job also means that if you lose your job because your company is downsizing or going through a pandemic, the fall is much deeper. Not only will you lose your income, but you’ll temporarily lose access to affordable healthcare.

> To gain credibility, universal health care advocates should probably drop some misleading rhetoric that now leads people to tune them out. The first type of mistake people make is saying that progressives’ Medicare-for-All bill is simply what every single other developed country has. The plan outlined in the bill covers dental, vision, hearing, reproductive care (including abortions) and mental health care while promising no premiums, deductibles, or copays, and a cap of $200 of out-of-pocket spending on non-preventive prescription drugs for people whose incomes exceeds twice the poverty line.
> Many European countries have universal systems that aren’t single-payer. And the Nordic social democracies, which do have a single-payer system, generally do not have a system like this with basically no cost-sharing. Norwegians pay between $19 and $42 per primary care visit and between $30 and $46 for specialist visits, though every adult has a deductible of around $500 above which the government will cover the rest. Denmark has copays too, with a cap of $538, and they don’t pay for adult dental care. Neither does Sweden for people over 23. In Finland, copayments are 20% of all health expenditure, averaging around $850 a year per person. Iceland’s out-of-pocket costs are over $800 per person.

> Housing doesn’t have to be have so much like capital, and in many places it isn’t. But in America it does: both the political left and right are attached to the idea of housing being a wealth creation strategy. The take is: housing can’t simultaneously produce wealth, be a safe investment, and be produced in enough quantity to avert crises. That’s the punchline. We want it to be part of two exclusive categories. - https://macwright.com/2020/08/01/recently.html https://www.citylab.com/perspective/2018/11/housing-cant-both-be-a-good-investment-and-be-affordable/574813/
> But houses are like cars or boats or tables or laptops — you want to live in a world where there are plenty of new ones being churned out all the time so they are easy to buy. In the world we have, housing is instead a source of “wealth” for tons of people. The government, in order to help people build wealth, helps you get a subsidized mortgage loan. Then you go buy a house, which itself bundles a depreciating durable good (the house) with a speculative asset (the land the house is built on). Then, you actually need to spend a lot of money fighting the inevitable deterioration of the depreciating durable good, while hoping to recoup your investment through appreciation of the price of land. This creates a perceived incentive to promote housing scarcity in order to boost the value of your leveraged asset. This is how we’re building wealth. But it’s pretty obvious that the United States of America as a whole cannot become a more prosperous country by making housing scarce. We’re actually impoverishing ourselves with this wealth-building strategy. Instead, you have people in pricey markets inhabiting subpar dwellings that just happen to be valuable. https://www.slowboring.com/p/wealth-weirdness
* _high rent blight_: waiting for demand, mortgage constrictions/securitization, keep property value high, tax deduction for leaving empty https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-are-there-so-many-shuttered-storefronts-in-the-west-village https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/opinion/nyc-commercial-rent-reform.html
* wait for demand to return
> First, because commercial leases are typically long, some landlords, especially those with other income streams, wager that it’s better to wait for demand to return than to commit to a cheap long-term lease. If a landlord has an offer today for $10,000 per month but thinks a $20,000-per-month tenant may appear in a year or three, he may decide to wait.
> Sometimes landlords...would be willing to rent for less money but are blocked....Mortgages for commercial properties in New York City typically set a minimum rent, which makes price cutting a form of default. The problem is compounded when mortgages have been securitized and the terms can be modified only by investor consensus.
> A related reason for artificially high rents has to do with how property values are determined. To accept $10,000 a month in rent from a property that once earned $20,000 a month could entail recognizing a multimillion-dollar decrease in the official property value
> Finally, there is the matter of tax deductions. While a property owner cannot legally deduct losses based on hoped-for rental income, losing money while one waits for a renter can be used to offset certain other forms of income.

institutional investors https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/06/blackrock-ruining-us-housing-market/619224/
> The U.S. has roughly 140 million housing units, a broad category that includes mansions, tiny townhouses, and apartments of all sizes. Of those 140 million units, about 80 million are stand-alone single-family homes. Of those 80 million, about 15 million are rental properties. Of those 15 million single-family rentals, institutional investors own about 300,000; most of the rest are owned by individual landlords. Of that 300,000, BlackRock—largely through its investment in the real-estate rental company Invitation Homes—owns about 80,000.
> Megacorps such as BlackRock, then, are not removing a large share of the market from individual ownership. Rental-home companies own less than half of one percent of all housing, even in states such as Texas, where they were actively buying up foreclosed properties after the Great Recession. Their recent buying has been small compared with the overall market.
> Besides, BlackRock and investors like it aren’t necessarily taking homes away from ordinary families. As the Vox reporter Jerusalem Demsas explains, institutional investors tend to buy homes that need significant repairs. That means they’re often competing with other investors—individuals who buy houses to rent them out, as a side gig or a main gig—not with typical young couples who are looking to turn a key and walk into a finished house. Meanwhile, institutional investors are more likely than individuals to report making improvements to their rental holdings and spend more per unit.

The economics incentives around urban planning -- rent controls, zoning, urban renewal -- seems inherently perilous bc you're really having a conversation about aesthetics ("what should the city look like?") and politics ("what type of people should live in the city?"). Versus, idk, something even as political as vaccine tiers, where everyone would agree that a meta concern to ordering is that everyone, regardless of their aesthetic preference or political affiliation, be vaccinated.

And maybe land use is just more zero sum. Which seems to be humans default when it comes to econ anyway. Von Mises thought the public was generally antimarket. People tend to perceive economic activity as transfer (wealth movement from one entity to another) vs. trade (mutally beneficial exchange).

> The Dead Pledge: At one level, this is an excellent history of how the modern mortgage market was born, and the role bailouts played in making it happen and fixing early mistakes. But it's also a great history of how the entire concept of banking changed to accommodate the growth of mortgages: historically, bankers did not make long-term loans, and mortgage loans were either made by rich individuals or by life insurance companies and other entities with long-duration liabilities. Banks have lots of deposits, and it's tempting to direct those into loans for housing, but the maturity mismatch inherent in funding a 30-year loan with demand deposits is a hard problem to solve. It's not just a banking-level problem, but a reflection of a real resources challenge: you need housing your entire life and it takes many years of saving to afford one. The mismatch exists no matter what, and the policy question is who can most effectively manage its risks. https://diff.substack.com/p/longreads-open-thread-bac

Normal people lack the technical competence to make judgments about what street features will have what impact; there’s more to life than pure technocracy, but these are issues with a significant technical element. The people who show up to community meetings and yell about things are an unrepresentative minority. The result of spending a lot of time gathering incoherent feedback from an unrepresentative group of people who don’t necessarily know what they are talking about is that you end up (slowly) doing things that either don’t work well or aren’t cost-effective. This leaves everyone feeling like the city is run by idiots and only further erodes trust...Of course, if you bypass community consultation and do something that turns out to not work, you’ll look like an idiot. But if your departments of public works and transportation are staffed by people who don’t know what they’re doing, that’s the problem, not a lack of community trust. https://www.slowboring.com/p/making-policy-for-a-low-trust-world

* does either the public or private market provide the type of housing we want? https://www.slowboring.com/p/public-housing-is-not-the-answer
> I’m not against repealing Faircloth, but I think the idea that this is the “first step” to addressing housing affordability is factually wrong and that centering public housing as the solution is confused. The general idea of major public investment is that the government can step up and provide goods that the private market doesn’t want to supply. That would be things like rural broadband, zero-carbon electricity, or basic scientific research. But there’s no problem attracting private capital investment to building more housing in high-cost areas; the problem is that it’s not allowed by zoning codes — zoning codes that would also disallow the construction of public housing regardless of what happens to the Faircloth Amendment.
> So if you live in Spring Valley and want to do something to help poor people but don’t want any new neighbors near you, then you might say “sure, raise my taxes and use them to build some new public housing towers in the poorest part of the city.” But to me, that’s a much worse outcome for both the city’s economy and for its low-income residents than one in which we allow more market-rate building where the demand is highest (i.e., rich neighborhoods) and then use the tax revenue that generates to put cash in the hands of the poor.

> One popular thesis comes from Professor Richard Florida. In 2006, Florida masterfully described The Rise of the Creative Class, a class that flocked to large, diverse, and liberal cities — from New York and San Francisco to Shanghai and London. The thesis was supported by Professor Ed Glaeser's Triumph of the City, an excellent book about why urbanization is good for the economy and the planet and why knowledge work depends on the "agglomeration" of people from related industries. These two theses did a great job describing (and predicting) the first 15 years of the 21st Century. The best and brightest did move to cities, and large cities enjoyed a renaissance of sorts. But there are reasons to believe that the concentration of creative people in a handful of large, diverse cities may have been the swan song of the industrial era rather than a harbinger of the post-industrial one.

> The creative class flocks to a handful of happy cities, abandoning the rest. And increasing economic inequality means the spread between rich and poor is growing too. I'd like to propose a hypothesis: that all these trends are instances of the same phenomenon. And moreover, that the cause is not some force that's pulling us apart, but rather the erosion of forces that had been pushing us together...The two forces were war (above all World War II), and the rise of large corporations.
> The effects of World War II were both economic and social. Economically, it decreased variation in income. Between 1942 and 1945 all wages were set by the National War Labor Board. Like the military, they defaulted to flatness. And this national standardization of wages was so pervasive that its effects could still be seen years after the war ended...the American custom of having employers pay for health insurance derives from efforts by businesses to circumvent NWLB wage controls in order to attract workers.
> The 20th century was the century of the big, national corporation. General Electric, General Foods, General Motors.
> But, like children's books, TV was also misleading. Dangerously misleading, for adults. In his autobiography, Robert MacNeil talks of seeing gruesome images that had just come in from Vietnam and thinking, we can't show these to families while they're having dinner.
> For most of the 20th century, working-class people tried hard to look middle class. You can see it in old photos. Few adults aspired to look dangerous in 1950.
> (In the UK, where taxes were even higher than in the US, companies would even pay their kids' private school tuitions.) One of the most valuable things the big companies of the mid 20th century gave their employees was job security, and this too didn't show up in tax returns or income statistics. So the nature of employment in these organizations tended to yield falsely low numbers about economic inequality.
> CEOs of big companies make more now than they used to, and I think much of the reason is prestige. In 1960, corporate CEOs had immense prestige. They were the winners of the only economic game in town. But if they made as little now as they did then, in real dollar terms, they'd seem like small fry compared to professional athletes and whiz kids making millions from startups and hedge funds.
> As big companies' oligopolies became less secure, they were less able to pass costs on to customers and thus less willing to overpay for labor. And as the Duplo world of a few big blocks fragmented into many companies of different sizes — some of them overseas — it became harder for unions to enforce their monopolies. As a result workers' wages also tended toward market price. Which (inevitably, if unions had been doing their job) tended to be lower.

> The form of fragmentation people worry most about lately is economic inequality, and if you want to eliminate that you're up against a truly formidable headwind — one that has been in operation since the stone age: technology. Technology is a lever. It magnifies work.
> If we think 20th century cohesion disappeared because of few policy tweaks, we'll be deluded into thinking we can get it back (minus the bad parts, somehow) with a few countertweaks. And then we'll waste our time trying to eliminate fragmentation, when we'd be better off thinking about how to mitigate its consequences.

[Farnsworth legal analyst 24]
> It just means when you compare values, don't talk about them in the abstract, talk about the actual choice in front of me, what am I getting, what am I giving up, how is that relative to where I already stand. It's very simple, it's very intuitive, but you know in public policy people don't always think in terms of the trade-offs...Marginalism is more scientific, more exact, more concrete, always trying to steer our attention to "what is going to work, given where we're starting from?" I think almost everyone gets it, and indeed almost everyone lives it in most of their choices, say when they go to the supermarket, "should I buy a bag of rice? how much rice do we have at home?". Hard to think of many people who can't think that way. But that said there's another part of the brain that switches on when issues are emotional or involve status rankings or politics and then that way of thinking flies out the window. And I'm just trying to nudge people to be a little more consisent, be more marginalistic, more concrete in a larger set of your choices.

> My high-level answer is that technology is the driving force of history. Technology favored centralization in the US from arguably 1754-1947 (join or die in the French and Indian War, unified national government post-Civil War, railroads, telegraph, radio, television, movies, mass media in general, and mass production) and is now favoring decentralization from roughly 1947 to the present day (transistor, personal computer, internet, remote work, smartphone, cryptocurrency). This thesis isn’t wholly original to me, of course — you can see major pieces of it in books like the Sovereign Individual, The Singularity is Near, Snow Crash, Ready Player One, and sci-fi in general. Indeed, the entire premise of sci-fi is that a new scientific invention has changed the world, though we only seem to fully understand that in the context of a movie (where the changes are often for the worse and happen in fast-forward montages), but not in the context of the world today (where the changes are often for the better and happen one day at a time). https://sotonye.substack.com/p/if-einstein-had-the-internet-an-interview

> Rob Wiblin: I actually think maybe the best argument against developing the ability to make these kinds of products locally is that the dependence of the US on China is actually really good, because it reduces the risk of war — that we should want the US to back down, because it would be so bad for the two countries to go to war. In fact, it’s perversely good that the US can’t stand on its own two feet. But I mean, it’s an interesting and slightly counterintuitive argument — it sounds a bit too clever by half.
> Matthew Yglesias: Well, that was Norman Angell’s argument before World War I. He said we have so much economic interdependency that the costs of European great power conflict would be so high that it can’t possibly happen, because it would be totally irrational. I mean, that was correct: World War I was very costly — everybody ended up much worse off as a result of that. But it didn’t mean it didn’t happen. So I hesitate to put too many eggs in that basket.

> The US has expensive labor, cheap and flexible capital, fairly cheap energy, and expensive land. As manufacturing matures, it tends to get relatively more capital-intensive, possibly more energy-intensive, and less labor- and land-intensive. So one way to look at the broad global macro trend in manufacturing is that as the rest of the world gets richer, the US's comparative disadvantage in manufacturing starts to decline...This doesn't mean that we'll run the story of globalization in reverse, and that the US will once again be the world's dominant manufacturer; you generally don't want your country to be making lots of shoes, lawn furniture, and toys domestically, unless the alternative is subsistence farming or starvation. https://www.thediff.co/p/aws-for-industry-but-better-the-railroad

> Why? Ponder this analogy. You ban all players over 7 feet tall from the NBA. How will the remaining players react? The optimistic scenario is that previously demoralized shorter players suddenly see a fantastic opportunity for stardom. They start practicing like crazy – and improvement naturally follows. The pessimistic scenario, however, is that shorter players realize that they no longer need to practice like crazy to stay in the NBA. So instead of redoubling their efforts, they slack off. Their skills stagnate – or even get worse. Notice: Even in the optimistic scenario, it is wishful thinking to assume that the shorter players will eventually improve so much that they actually become better players than the 7-foot-plus players who were summarily banned from the sport. If you’re lucky, the shorter players will improve for a while, then hit a plateau well below the standards of the players they replaced.
> These studies revealed that win–win denial is pervasive, with buyers consistently seen as less likely to benefit from transactions than sellers.

If you’re a lawyer, yes, there’s some complicated way in which you’re subject to international pressure, but you’ve basically chosen a career path that doesn’t force you to compete globally.

> One is "shrinkflation," and the general problem of how to measure price levels. I wrote about this last year: some companies have found that it's better to keep prices constant and change products than to keep products constant and change prices. In food, this means using cheaper ingredients or selling smaller packages at the same price. In software, it means moving some features into higher-priced tiers. Mature and consumption-heavy economies have a lot of this, both because the talent that could be focused on optimizing manufacturing is instead focused on optimizing selling and because these economies produce more SQL-queryable bits per dollar of GDP. https://diff.substack.com/p/the-2x2-inflation-debate
> I think a third component here is, I think, still more broadly spiritual, civilizational yet, which is to try to turn China’s style of capitalism into more of a German direction, into less of a U.S. or U.K. direction.

I think China is looking far more longingly at Germany, which is driven quite a bit more by manufacturing firms, by industrial firms, by firms that are not too large. I think that China is much more keen to be practicing manufacturing instead of delving still further into digital technologies as well as manufacturing, which is really the U.S. competence over the last two decades. https://supchina.com/2022/01/20/urban-design-cultural-stunting-and-tech-regulation-in-china-explained-by-dan-wang/

> With its [China's] emphasis on the real economy, it is trying to avoid the fate of Hong Kong, where local elites have reorganized the productive forces completely around sustaining high property prices and managing mainland liquidity flows. With its emphasis on economic growth, it cannot be like Taiwan, whose single bright corporate beacon is surrounded by a mass of firms undergoing genteel decline. With its emphasis on manufacturing, it cannot be like the UK, which is so successful in the sounding-clever industries—television, journalism, finance, and universities—while seeing a falling share of R&D intensity and a global loss of standing among its largest firms.
> While promoting the status of science and technology with one hand, the Chinese government has with its other hand reined in the activities of consumer internet companies. I’ve never stopped lamenting the marketing trick that California pulled off to situate consumer internet as the highest form of technology, as if Tencent and Facebook are the surest signs that we live a technologically-accelerating civilization. The “tech” giants are highly-capable companies that print cash. But they’re barely engaged in the creation of intellectual property, excelling instead on business-model innovation and the exploitation of network effects. It’s become apparent in the last few months that the Chinese leadership has moved towards the view that hard tech is more valuable than products that take us more deeply into the digital world. Xi declared this year that while digitization is important, “we must recognize the fundamental importance of the real economy… and never deindustrialize.” This expression preceded the passage of securities and antitrust regulations, thus also pummeling finance, which along with tech make up the most glamorous sectors today. The optimistic scenario is that these actions compress the wage and status premia of the internet and finance sectors, such that we’ll see fewer CVs that read: “BS Microelectronics, Peking; software engineer, Airbnb” or “PhD Applied Mathematics, Princeton; VP, Citibank.”
> Are there enduring advantages to being a producer-friendly economy? The west this year made a political decision to direct stimulus to consumers, while China offered minimal support to households and concentrated on helping production. Its implicit view is that production is more valuable and more difficult to stimulate than consumption. More generally, Chinese officials tend to be incredulous of US complaints of excessive subsidies to manufacturers; they tend to ask what the problem is, as if they’ve been accused of the sin of loving a child too much.

> Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is arguably the greatest force for world peace in existence; it provides essential inputs to China's most important exports, and is, from a CCP perspective, inconveniently located in land that China claims but cannot govern. But this also means, annoyingly, that certain kinds of catch-up growth are worrisome for the world since they reduce the cost of conflict between China and Taiwan; China's chip industry set production records in June, up 44% since last year. The country is still behind the cutting edge; China expects high-volume 14nm chips by the end of next year, while Samsung and Apple were selling devices with 14nm chips in late 2014 and early 2015. But it's still worth watching; catch-up growth happens faster than Moore's Law. And supply chain ties can ensure peace: part of the argument for the EU's ancestor, the European Coal and Steel Community, was that supply chains criss-crossing Germany and France would make war between the two countries impossible. And the drop in war frequency in Europe since then has been unprecedented, although there are other explanatory factors. Still, it's an idea worth taking seriously: mutual economic dependency constrains countries, which is another way of saying that every time a country finds a new way to be self-sufficient, it has new options to choose its own destiny. https://diff.substack.com/p/newsletters-can-move-markets
