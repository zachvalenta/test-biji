> Any free time has been cooking, playing basketball and fighting with my lady. Basketball first, this bit about watching. One thing I like about Chinese announcers is that they're quieter, let the game breath more; there's a level of patter that seems roughly consistent between all sports broadcasts in the US, even events (downhill slalom, baseball) that require less talking; NBA broadcasts in the Chinese style would be quite striking if aired stateside. Chinese announcers have less verve though, and their vocabulary of hoop seems considerably smaller; they're like 1960s announcers trying to describe alley-oops without "airtime" and "hammer" and "boomshakalaka". - to Emma, 2013.10.21

* push and pull of Serena-Halep at high-speed -> Linares combo -> high-speed chess
* _prize_ fighting -> post-CTE and boxing wild west vs. NFL disingenuousness, American patriotic
* fights to get hooked on: Marquez-Diaz, Crawford-Gamboa, Cotto-谁?
* wild diversity: USA, Mexico, Japan, Germany, Russia, England, Argentina, Ghana vs. weird omissions (Spain, France, Canada, Brazil) -> styles: conservative German vs. technical Russian (Dervey) technical American (b-hop) technical technical Mexican (Canelo) vs. untechnical -> Linares moving to Japan (speaks Japanese), Kameda moving to Mexico (wife is Mexican) i.e. not the high school basketball prospect living in Europe for a year
* biggest audiences in the sport are the Mexican and British (Budweiser adverts to Tecate, William Hill)
* ethics: Saudis in golf vs. boxing

remember Jim Lampley one time saying, on the topic of the moral culpability of the viewing public to such a brutal sport, that as long as there are prizes there will always be prize fighters.

makes me think of a guy on an ESPN undercard a few years ago. was mugged, beat up 2 guys. temporarily accused of assault himself. spent week in prison, 2 more fights in prison to earn respect. released on Friday, weigh in Saturday, fought (and won) on Sunday. said the prison diet helped him make weight for fight. after the announcer recounted this story, he said, "Only in boxing, ladies and gentleman".

> Lightweight Avery Sparrow was arrested Friday morning in Los Angeles, and his scheduled bout Saturday night against Ryan Garcia in Carson, California, has been canceled. 
> Sparrow's promoter, Russell Peltz, said the fighter was wanted by police for allegedly "brandishing a handgun in a domestic dispute in April." 
> "You can't serve Avery because he doesn't live anywhere," Peltz said. "He lives with friends, he lives with family. He was out here [in Los Angeles] for three months. So there's nowhere to serve him."
> According to Peltz, Sparrow had returned to the Philadelphia area in mid-August. 
> "He felt he could get better sparring there, and he trained in Cherry Hill (New Jersey) for the last month."
> But on Friday morning, before the scheduled weigh-in, Sparrow was apprehended at a Los Angeles-area Target store, according to Peltz.
> "They were circling the area, there were a lot of cop cars out early, he said, when he was out running, and they had a helicopter," Peltz said. "They cornered his car, he and four or five of his buddies were on the ground, and they arrested him."
