# TACTICS

> The maximum return will likely be on tactics. https://chess.stackexchange.com/a/2772

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skIK8ksqQ2Q https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEehFvnO3ZA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJIWbdoXLn8
* _tactic_: sequence of moves to win piece 📙 Farnsworth
* aka combination
* _double threat_: threaten 2 pieces w/ single move 📙 Farnsworth 1.3.1
* matters more than strategy
> Strategy and tactics both are important, but tactics are more important. If you're a whiz at finding clever moves that take your opponent’s pieces, you will be a terrifying opponent, have a good time playing chess, and win lots of games regardless of whether you know a great deal about strategy. If you're a whiz at strategy but not much good at tactics, you will have trouble winning or having fun because your pieces will keep getting taken. 📙 Farnsworth 7

## discovery

> 2 vs. 2

* _discovery_: move one of your pieces out of the way of another thereby creating separate attacks

## fork

> 1 vs. 2

* _forking square_: same color as knight's current square and forked pieces 📙 Farnsworth 25-27
* knights are slippery 📙 Farnsworth 2.1.1
> it allows a knight to attack other pieces without fear of being captured by them; and it enables a knight to make jumps and deliver threats that are surprising to the eye
> if your knight is on the same diagonal as an enemy piece and separated from it by one square, the knight is three moves away from being able to attack the piece.

## pin

> 1 vs. 2

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxO7i-NZMcI
* _pin_: fork w/ two of opponent's pieces on the same line
* have to work fast before piece behind pin able to slip away
* _absolute pin_: aligned w/ king
* _relative pin_: aligned w/ other material
* _skewer_: pin in which opponent is forced to move first piece out of the way and enabling capture of the second

vocab
* _assisted_: i.e. how checkmate always happens (even queen cannot checkmate by herself)
* _smother_: diable movement using opponents own pieces [BF 30]

## moves

defense
* _overworked_: defending more than one other pawn/piece https://www.chesstactics.org/the-double-attack/the-knight-fork/distracting-the-guard/2_1_5_2.html
* _interpose_: get between piece and opponent 📙 Fischer 20
* _outpost_: square that is hard to attack 📙 Farnsworth 79-80

attack the guard
* pin 📙 Farnsworth 2.1.3
* _exchange_: alternate captures
* _distract_: exchange that leaves square uncovered 📙 Farnsworth 2.1.4-5
* _manipulate_: forcing move that pushes target onto forking square 📙 Farnsworth 2.1.9

offense
* _attack_: threaten piece 📙 Farnsworth 2.1.1
* _cover_: threaten square 📙 Fischer 31
* _pass time_: thowaway move to force opponent to commit more conclusively on their next move

forcing
> No doubt you have heard about good players seeing ahead five moves, or a dozen moves, or more; how do they do that when their opponents have so many possible responses to pick from? The usual answer is that their opponents don’t have so many choices after all. 📙 Farnsworth 1.3.3
* _mate threat_: possible checkmate
* _check_: force king to move or another piece to interpose
> Another old lesson repeats: don’t take for granted that your opponent will reply to your captures by recapturing; he may be able to make other captures or threats of his own first. The beauty of working with checks is that they avoid those risks.
* _capture_: take opponent's piece
> Checks, captures, and mate threats therefore are known as forcing moves. In other words, they are moves that force your opponent to pick from a small set of possible replies. They are the essence of tactical chess; they allow you to dictate your opponent’s moves and thus control how the board will look two or three or more moves from now. But checks, captures, and mate threats tend to be the most interesting and important kind of forcing moves because they so powerfully limit your opponent's choice of replies.

## strategy

ideas
* _develop_: give material/pieces a job to do
* pieces guard material

> He recently stated that he has learned some new chess ideas from AlphaZero, but more importantly he has shown up better prepared in the openings than his opponents, probably for the first time in his career.  Yet his preparation has taken an extraordinary spin.  Other grandmasters prepare the opening in the hope of achieving an early advantage over their opponents.  Magnus’s preparation, in contrast, is directed at achieving an early disadvantage in the game, perhaps willing to tolerate as much as -0.5 or -0.6 by the standards of the computer (a significant but not decisive disadvantage, with -2 signifying a lost position).  Nonetheless these are positions “out of book” where Magnus nonetheless feels he can outplay his opponent, and this is mostly opponents from the world top ten or fifteen...And it is hard to counter someone looking for a disadvantage!
