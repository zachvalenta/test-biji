D'oh! Just seeing this now. Seconding the recommendation of Pulleyblank (Classical Chinese Grammar) -- it's more of a reference book than a textbook, but it's an absolutely fantastic resource for anybody setting out to learn classical Chinese.
Most Chinese students use the 古代漢語 series edited by Wang Li 王力. This should be easy to find in pretty much any bookstore if you're in China, and it's a good introduction as long as you don't mind reading long passages in traditional characters. (Or maybe there's a 简体 version around these days. My copy is 繁體-only, but it's an old edition.) On the other hand, it's intended for native speakers of Chinese, so it might not be the most gentle introduction.

- I began studying Classical Chinese with A First Course in Literary Chinese by Harold Shadick. It worked for me, but more recent textbooks will probably do a better job of explaining things. It also uses Wade-Giles, which some people find annoying. (I'm not one of them.)

- I recently looked over A Practical Primer of Literary Chinese by Paul F. Rouzer and thought it looked promising. Rouzer's textbook assumes that students will not necessarily know Mandarin -- this is a good approach, and one I'd love to see more of...

- ...but you might prefer Classical Chinese Primer by John C.Y. Wang et al, which occasionally saves itself and the reader time by explaining things by analogy to modern Chinese -- 矣 behaving similarly to modern 了 and that sort of thing.

## hiring

They prod, “Are you religious, or political?” They pry, “Can you eat spicy food?” A cushy salary is destined to line your pockets, but only if you get the answers right. “What nationality is your wife?” At this point you might need to stop and ask yourself, are you really qualified to interview for a job in China?
The job market back home has disappeared. You’ve whizzed through three months of intensive Chinese training. You’ve forgotten how to vacuum ever since you discovered your ayi. But don’t fret, prep up with this lesson and you’ll be sure to ace the interview, or mianshi, without a hitch.
The basics of hiring
to hire  zhāopìn 招聘
position  zhíwèi 职位
resume  jiǎnlì 简历
academic experience  xuéli 学历
professional experience  jīnɡyàn 经验
face-to-face interview  miànshì 面试
Know your enemy As with a Western job interview, the more you know about the company, the position and the people assessing you beforehand, the better your answers will be on the big day. Chinese HR managers can be vague on meeting details, and many have been known to suggest things like, “Why don’t we just meet some time on Wednesday.”
The exact position of the person you are meeting with will often be just as vague. And on the day of the interview, they may ask you to procure documents you didn’t think to prepare. Find out as much as possible beforehand. It’s up to you to ask for specifics.
What’s better for you, morning or afternoon? We should set a specific time.  nín kàn zǎoshɑnɡ háishì xiàwǔ ɡènɡ fānɡbiàn ？ zánmen dìnɡ ɡè jùtǐ shíjiān bɑ. 您看早上还是下午更方便？咱们定个具体时间吧.
Who will I be meeting with?  dào shíhou wǒ huì ɡēn shuí jiànmiàn ？ 到时候我会跟谁见面？
What department is Zhao Zong responsible for?  qǐnɡwèn zhàozǒnɡ zài ɡōnɡsī zhǔyào fùzé shénme yèwù ？ 请问赵总在公司主要负责什么业务？
Do I need to prepare any special kind of documents?  wǒ xūyào zhǔnbèi shénme tèbié de zīliào mɑ ？ 我需要准备什么特别的资料吗？
The meet and greet For the interview there is no need to dress up in a full suit. A crisp button-down shirt with slacks is all that’s called for. An HR manager will likely be the first to interview you in person, but only after giving you a grand tour of the office and showing off mementos of the company’s outstanding success. Be polite, show interest and bring a little of the anticipated laowai charm. Getting on well with the administrative pawns paves the way for a good word with the boss and smooth payroll processing in the future.
Hi, I’m Steven—we spoke on the phone. I didn’t expect the company’s HR manager to be so young.  nín hǎo ， wǒshì Steven ，wǒmen tōnɡɡuò diànhuà 。 méi xiǎnɡ dào ɡōnɡsī de rénshì jīnɡlǐ jìnɡrán zhème niánqīnɡ 。 您好，我是Steven，我们通过电话。没想到公司的人事经理竟然这么年轻。.
This office is really nice. Are these all photos of Zhao Zong with country leaders? bàn ɡōnɡ huánjìnɡ zhēn hǎo 。 zhèxiē zhàopiàn dōu shì zhàozǒnɡ ɡēn ɡuójiā lǐnɡdǎo rén pāi de mɑ ？ 办公环境真好。这些照片都是赵总跟国家领导人拍的吗？
Winning hearts and minds At the heart of the Chinese mianshi is a mixed bag of standard interview questions, not unlike what you would expect elsewhere, lumped in with some bizarre inquisitions. Know what to expect and you won’t be stumped.
First, companies typically send a very important person to interview foreigners, someone so high up on the totem pole that he may have little knowledge of what is involved in the day-to-day job. Fret not. You’re not meeting the zong to get a checklist of office duties. This is your chance to woo the boss with your Chinese-ness. You can get the pertinent professional details later… say, from that HR manager you just schmoozed with.
The interviewer will be fascinated with your language and cultural assimilation. Don’t get annoyed or rush through the inordinate amount of time you spend talking about stuff that has nothing to do with the job. This is your chance to milk your Chinese for what it’s worth.
Interviewer: Steven, how long have you been in China? Steven, nǐ lái zhōnɡɡuó duōjiǔ le ？ Steven，你来中国多久了？
You: Almost a year. But I studied Chinese language and history for two years in Canada. chà bù duō yìnián le 。 zhīqián wǒzài jiānádà xuéxí le liǎnɡnián zhōnɡwén hé zhōnɡɡuó lìshǐ 。 差不多一年了。之前我在加拿大学习了两年中文和中国历史。
Interviewer: Wow, your Chinese is pretty good! How did you learn so well?  nǐ zhōnɡ wén shuō dé zhēn bú cuò! nǐ zěn me xué dé zhè me hǎo ？ 你中文说得真不错! 你怎么学得这么好？
You: Oh stop it, you’re exaggerating. I can just get by, and I don’t have any special learning tricks.  nín ɡuòjiǎnɡ le ， wǒ de zhōnɡwén hái còuhe ， méi shénme xuéxí jìqiǎo 。 您过奖了，我的中文还凑合，没什么学习技巧。
After some more compliment exchanging, and maybe a brief speech on how much you love the food from your interviewer’s province, the conversation will eventually touch on the job. In a country with an immense labor force and labor mobility, employers are naturally obsessed with retention. To this end, personal questions—questions that would get you in serious trouble back home—are normal interview fare here.
For example, it’s standard to ask interviewees for their age, marital status, number of kids, and personal plans. Be truthful when answering these questions, but it does help if you paint yourself as a stable employee with a long-term plan. If you have a family, mention it—marriage and children garner instant respect from the Chinese.
How long are you planning to stay in China?  nǐ dǎsuɑn zài zhōnɡɡuó dài duōjiǔ ？ 你打算在中国待多久？
It would be a push to say five years, but I’ll be here for at least a year or two. wǒ bùɡǎn shuō wǔnián ， dànshì zuì qǐmǎ wǒ huì zài liú yí dào liǎnɡnián 。 我不敢说五年，但是最起码我会再留一到两年。
Are your parents living outside of China? nǐ de jiārén dōu zài ɡuówài mɑ ？ 你的家人都在国外吗？
My parents live in Canada, but my wife is from Hebei. wǒ fù mǔ zài jiā ná dà 。 wǒ ài ren lǎo jiā zài hé běi 。 我父母在加拿大。我爱人老家在河北。
Your wife is Chinese? Good, Chinese place importance on feelings. nǐ àiren shì zhōnɡɡuó rén ？ hǎo ā ， zhōnɡɡuó rén zhònɡ ɡǎnqínɡ 你爱人是中国人？好啊，中国人重感情。
Following bonding over your mutual love of all things Chinese, the interviewer may ask you to present your strengths and weaknesses. Be modest without undercutting yourself. You should essentially do the same thing you would do in an English interview—put your best foot forward—but a hanxu (含蓄, modest) and weiwan (委婉, euphemistic) turn of words is more culturally appropriate than Western-style aggressive self-promotion.
Do you think you’ll be interested in this type of work? nǐ duì zhèyànɡ de ɡōnɡzuò ɡǎn xìnɡqù mɑ ？ 你对这样的工作感兴趣吗？
I’m very interested. In fact, I’ve always wanted to try this type of work. hěn ɡǎn xìnɡqù 。 qíshí wǒ yìzhí xiǎnɡ chánɡshì zhèyànɡ de ɡōnɡzuò 。 很感兴趣。其实我一直想尝试这样的工作。
I don’t think I’ll have any problems with planning. And even though I don’t have much experience in sales, I’ll do my best to learn quickly.  wǒ rènwéi cèhuà zhè fānɡmiàn méi shénme wèntí 。 xiāoshòu zhè kuàiér wǒde jīnɡyàn shǎo yìxiē ， búɡuò wǒ huì nǔlì qù xué 。 我认为策划这方面没什么问题。销售这块儿我的经验少一些，不过我会努力去学。
Once you’ve proven yourself to be a serious candidate, not someone looking for a career stepping-stone or study-abroad frivolity, there might still be an ambush question.
Are you religious? Do you have any strong political beliefs?
Are you religious? Do you have any strong political beliefs? nǐ xìn jiāo mɑ ？ yǒu shénme zhènɡzhì xìnyǎnɡ mɑ ？ 你信教吗？有什么政治信仰吗？
My parents are Christian, but I hardly ever go to church. I don’t have any political beliefs. I just love being in China.  wǒ fùmǔ xìn jīdū jiāo ， dànshì wǒ hěnshǎo qù jiàotánɡ 。 wǒ méiyǒu shénme zhènɡzhì xìnyǎnɡ ， zhī shì yíɡè zhōnɡɡuó mí. 我父母信基督教，但是我很少去教堂。我没有什么政治信仰，只是一个中国迷。
With assessment questions out of the way, the zong usually makes an exit and you’ll get down to business discussing the important stuff—money—with HR. In some instances, companies (especially those affiliated with government agencies) have very fixed salaries for specific positions and ranks. Most of the time, however, employers want to hear how much you think you’re worth. The trick is to quote a number high enough that there’s room to bargain down, but not so high that you scare off the offer.
When the interview finally wraps, remember to thank your interviewers for their time. Post-mianshi, expect a call very soon (if it’s a positive answer) or not at all (if it’s a “nay”). It’s not uncommon to hear back on Monday with an offer to start on Wednesday. Have your phone handy and be prepared to accept, decline or negotiate when you get that call.
What range is your current (previous) salary in? nǐ mùqián （ yǐqián ） de xīnshuǐ zài shénme fànwéi ？ 你目前（以前）的薪水在什么范围？
What kind of salary are you looking for now?  nǐ de lǐxiǎnɡ yuèxīn dàɡài duōshǎo ？ 你的理想月薪大概多少？
We might not be able to reach that number. I’ll have to discuss with Zhao Zong.  wǒmen kěnénɡ dá búdào zhèɡe biāozhǔn 。 rànɡ wǒ ɡēn zhàozǒnɡ shānɡliɑnɡ yíxià 。 我们可能达不到这个标准。让我跟赵总商量一下 。
Happy hunting! zhǎo ɡōnɡzuò jiāyóu ！ 找工作加油！
