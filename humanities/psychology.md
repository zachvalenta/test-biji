> Their underlying motive is to say things that sound good – to yourself and other people. Why bother? To feel good about yourself – and persuade other people to feel good about you. Saying what sounds noble, and doing what feels pleasant: Now that’s human nature. https://www.econlib.org/my-profound-understanding-of-human-nature/
> What so many intellectuals miss is how bored and listless these people on both the right and left feel, and how energizing and *good* it feels to believe the lies, no matter what side they come from. It's ennobling. It's heroic. It's self-actualizing....This is the lashing out of the bored bourgeoisie, not "stories that feel true to them." These are stories they WANT to be true because it would ennoble their own dull lives to believe it. https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/1411759765949140996
* wanting drama https://www.slowboring.com/p/fake-crisis
> Nobody knows why most people are taking their shoes off at airports or why, if that’s important, you can just buy your way out of it getting TSA Precheck. These days, of course, all the chic people on both the left and right are critics of GWOT overreach, which is sensible and commendable of them. But in a way that I don’t think they appreciate, they are heirs to the same middle children of history syndrome — basically bored and blowing things out of proportion.
> We yearn for drama. The triumphalist "end of history" moment of the late 1990s struck lots of people as intolerably boring (which is exactly what Francis Fukuyama’s "The End of History" says will happen), and people put their creative energies to work evading the boredom.

> Epidemiologists began by telling us COVID-19 was nothing to worry about and that masks did not work. They failed to understand and communicate the simple fact that this was a respiratory disease, not one that spread through contact with surfaces. And while, as Philippe Lemoine shows, it may have been rational to support lockdowns when our knowledge was limited, when it became clear that they didn’t have much of an effect, most restrictions should have been lifted given their massive costs. A recent poll of epidemiologists showed that 81% of them wanted to keep Americans wearing masks indoors for at least another year, despite the invention of a vaccine that brings the risk of hospitalization or death to zero, and the fact that we are approaching the point where everyone who wants a vaccine is able to get one for free. The next public health crisis may cause us to defer to the same experts again, a truly frightening thought given their extreme irrationality. These failures cannot be explained by epidemiology being too hard of a science. We know this because, throughout the pandemic, non-epidemiologists like Alex Tabarrok and Zeynep Tufekci have usually been ahead of the field, which has all but admitted this by eventually moving to their position weeks or months after they originally made their arguments. It is not simply that the prominent epidemiologists are wrong, but that they refuse to do anything resembling cost-benefit analysis.

> I've always found it very interesting that everyone wants to shame groups they don't sympathize with, but say it doesn't work for groups they sympathize with. Liberals are fine with shaming anti-vaxx but not drug addicts, cons opposite. Sort of makes me think that shaming works. Before the 1960s, we used to do more to shame drug users, criminals, and single moms. Since we stopped, we got more of these behaviors. Now we shame "racism" as the greatest sin, and we get less of that.

* _Milgram experiment_: obediance to authority
> People in fifty different states have been given fifty different (and fluctuating) sets of often arbitrary rules. And people in fifty different states have, by and large, obeyed. You could protest, “Each governor is just ‘ordering’ their citizens to do what they would have done on their own volition.” But that’s grossly overstated. The store mask mandates in Virginia and Texas were very similar this winter, and almost universally observed. But when both states dropped mask mandates, most northern Virginians kept wearing masks in stores for a month and more. In Texas, in contrast, masks in stores vanished almost overnight. As individuals, Texans wanted less caution than Virginians. Yet both groups obeyed their authorities. https://www.econlib.org/the-american-experiment-in-federalist-dictatorship/

> I think lots of people need to understand bad events in terms of the bad acts of specific bad human beings, which tend to entail the positing of perhaps more “conspiracy” (in the sense of secret collaboration) than is really there. The Obama administration’s approach to the financial crisis, where we got a huge overhaul of financial regulatory institutions but no naming names of bad actors or prosecuting of individuals, was sort of the apotheosis of the systemic approach to the world, and it ended up being really politically and emotionally unsatisfying. https://www.slowboring.com/p/qanon-is-not-a-conspiracy-theory

> My basic view of financial drama is that finance consists of people slouched in chairs staring at computers, so the drama is … it is there, it is very much there, there is a ton of drama, I yield to no one in my appreciation for the drama of credit derivatives or whatever, but it is not necessarily the sort of drama that conventionally comes across in, say, a Hollywood movie. A person slouches in a chair, staring at a spreadsheet; he moves some numbers around, nods in satisfaction, and types a chat message. We cut to the person at the other end of that chat message, who slouches in her chair, reads the chat message, nods, and puts an order into the order-entry system. We cut to the computer at the other end of the order-entry system, which silently and invisibly executes the order. Fortunes have been staked, daring intellectual leaps have been made, capital has been mobilized, price signals have gone out that will change the course of world events, but also nothing has happened, nothing that really shows up on screen anyway. https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-19/gamestop-hearing-featured-no-cats

> For example, every time the media blames a fire or a storm on climate change, it’s a dubious argument in the sense that those are events that belong to weather, not climate. You can never attribute a particular event to a trend. It’s also the case, given that there is an availability bias in human cognition, that people tend to be more influenced by images and narratives and anecdotes than trends. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/09/06/magazine/steven-pinker-interview.html

A true comrade in the struggle would deny that any progress has been made or insist that any good news is trivial...the model where you sketch out an idealized policy endpoint, then wage political combat, then win, then implement your vision just isn’t how anything actually happens....The point is that politics is a process, and that’s especially true in a country like the United States that has a lot of institutional veto points...Brown v Board of Education was the culmination of a 15-year litigation strategy that started with a law school case in 1938. But even though the NAACP won in court in 1954, real desegregation didn’t happen until the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which in turn built upon the Civil Rights Act of 1960 and its predecessor, the Civil Rights Act of 1957. https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-cares-superdole-was-a-huge-success

A lot of issues have that same structure (global public health, lead contamination, pandemic prevention, asteroid detection, animal welfare), but unlike the typical important neglected issue, climate has a ton of money behind it. The actual state of opinion on climate is hard to characterize, but I think it’s summed up pretty well by these two facts: 69% of Americans say the United States should take "aggressive" action to fight climate change. 34% of Americans say they would be willing to pay $100 more in taxes per year to curb emissions.

It's the IP version of homesteading, or Lockean property rights: if you put enough effort into an un-owned idea, it's yours... To small-scale idea-homesteaders, this is mostly good news: if any of the output of your work could involve public writing, it's worth it to apply a short and ideally catchy name to a concept that you find yourself using more often than anyone else. It's not an asset in accounting terms, but it's very much like digital real estate: a claim on future attention.

The problem is that people don't judge their happiness using the relative experiences of previous decades or centuries; we focus on the present, how we compare with our peers, and other images of where we think we should be.

> If there are reasons to be skeptical about election polling, then issue polling is probably in even worse shape. Surveys about how people will vote can be checked against reality, and adjusted when they fail. But issue polling doesn’t even have that advantage. While election polling arguably resembles a real science because it has some built-in accountability, issue polling is like academic fields that can move further and further away from reality because there isn’t even the possibility of accountability.
> Of course, even if you reach a representative sample of people willing to be honest with you, issue polling has the problem that so much depends on how questions are worded and what facts are presented to people.

> You’ve probably heard statistics about how 50% of transgender youth attempt suicide before age 21. This paper tries to analyze the situation in more depth. The 50% number usually comes from surveys, but there’s some evidence people exaggerate on surveys, rounding up “I think about it a lot” to “I attempted”. The authors gather data on completed suicides among trans people, and find that they’re about 0.01%/year (which is about 5x the cisgender rate). If we suppose that people have about 5 years between becoming transgender and turning 21, then the 50% attempted suicide rate → 0.05% completed suicide rate implies that 1/1000th of the youth who report attempting suicide on surveys complete suicide - which sounds about right to me [but see this comment for a critique] https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/links-for-february

Basically all the issue polling you see are funded by issue advocacy groups that are specifically making polls for the purpose of being able to say "ah, it turns out 80% of people support this or support that"...there's something called "survey acquiescence bias", which is a fancy way of saying, if you ask someone taking a survey whether they support a policy or oppose a policy, if you give them a yes or no question, they usually say yes.

> On the one hand, you have people doing polls to go to the media, for public consumption. Then you have people doing polls to issue advocates, who want polls that say their positions are popular. And then you have people doing polls because they’re trying to win campaigns. Survey methods are the same across these things, but what your incentives are and what you actually care about are pretty different. Unfortunately, for the mass public, to get a good read on public opinion — like a rigorous look at how things are without putting a lot of English on it with question wording — you do have to talk to the people who are doing private work for political campaigns. They are the ones who have the strongest incentive to get the question right — not in terms of the survey sample, but in terms of what questions you ask people.
> It’s the stress testing in particular that’s important. There’s a phenomenon called acquiescence bias, where if you ask people questions, they’re inclined to say yes. Researchers used to think that this had something to do with talking to people on the phone, and they were very bullish when internet polling first started. They thought they were going to get rid of this, but they didn’t. Which seems a little odd, because you could imagine that you don’t want to fight with the guy on the phone — you want to agree. But it’s quite common, and unless you give people the argument/counterargument, you can show that all kinds of things are popular, and contradictory things.
> This is not breaking new ground — this is Converse’s classic work on public opinion. But people don’t have really deep and consistent views, which sometimes gets taken to mean that you could get away with anything in politics. But that’s also not true: there’s very consistent patterns of public backlash and resistance to things that raise middle-class people’s taxes — in particular to high-salience taxes, to increases in the cost of energy. You see that not just in the US, but really around the world.
> When the price of gasoline spiked in the United States a few months ago, it was a huge deal politically. People were losing their shit about it. Probably the best media poll on this is a Reuters survey where they asked people, “Should we take drastic action to stop climate change?” Most people said yes. Then they asked, “Would you be willing to pay $100 a year more in taxes to stop climate change?” People said no. A hundred dollars a year is not that drastic, you know? I spend $100 a year on things that I don’t think are important at all.

https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/matthew-yglesias-pundits-fallacy-military-intervention/#issues-with-trusting-public-opinion-polls-005118
> Yeah. Another general concern I have in this area is the idea that just a random person who you might phone up has opinions about the child tax credit or all of these other policy issues that someone somewhere cares about, and wants to know what people think. They have no opinion on so many things, just as I have no opinion on the great majority of topics, because I’ve never thought about them and I don’t really care about them.
> Now, what would be harder to say is, “What would people think about this subject if they studied it intensively for months?” But they’re not going to study it intensively for months. What they’re going to see is some pro and con ads on television occasionally, that they do not engage with very deeply. Just as I’m sure there’s lots of things you don’t have an opinion on, but somebody who knows you well can develop a pretty good mental model of you. Or they don’t even need to know you that well, to be like, “OK, this is a longtermist, this is an effective altruist, this is a cosmopolitan — so how is he going to come out on this question that I am factually well informed about once he becomes better informed?” Because we can make these kinds of predictions.
* Caplan
> But I’ve also heard this other line of research that the selfish voter hypothesis is kind of wrong, because voters very often take positions that are largely expressive about communicating their values, because their views and how they vote makes very little difference to the actual outcome. So if you enjoy saying, “It would be good for taxes to be higher,” then that can massively outweigh the downside of the tiny possibility that you saying that could actually cause taxes on you to be increased.

> argued that human beings are poltical by nature, and that their natural capacities incline them to flourish in society. The three early modern philosophers [Hobbes, Locke, Rosseau], by contrast, argued that human beings are not naturally social, but that society is a kind of artifice that allows people to achieve what they cannot get on their own. 📙 Fukuyama origins 26
* _Hobbes_: humans asocial, trade liberty for promise of protection against fellow man 📙 Leviathan (1651)
> The state of nature is thus characterized by "Warre...of every man against every man" and "solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short". To escape from this perilous situation, human beings to give their natural liberty to do as they please inn return for other people respecting their right to life. The state, or Leviathan, enforces these reciprocal committments 📙 Fukuyama origins 27
> This premise also underlies contemporary neoclassical economics, which builds its model on the assumption that human beings are rational beings who want to maximize their individual utility or incomes. But it is in fact individualism and not sociability that developer over the course of human history...Aristotle was more correct than these early modern liberal theorists when we said that human beings were political by nature.

> Public discourse tends to be dominated by one issue at a time. There is often one topic that even individuals and institutions that are usually apolitical become expected to take strong stands on. This is the “current thing.” After 9/11, it was terrorism and Middle East wars for a while. Public attention to shootings of young black men kicked off with the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012 and George Floyd is just the latest in a long series of these cases. For a few years at the start of the Trump era, “white supremacy” somehow became the most important thing in the world as minorities started shifting a bit towards Republicans...Is there any correlation between how important something is and whether or not it attains the status of current thing? At best, there seems to be a weak one. COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine are pretty important. But terrorism, white supremacy, and police shootings of black men are such tiny problems in modern America that if we were a logical society we would all but ignore them. Something like the process of aging, a major tragedy every human is experiencing every moment of their life, isn’t even considered a problem that policy should try to solve. Moreover, being into the current thing usually implies not only thinking about the current thing, but following the crowd with regards to how to approach it. That means for the current thing bias to be correct, one has to not only believe that elite discourse has its priorities correct, but that its solutions are also correct, and are better than doing nothing. https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/how-to-think-about-the-current-thing

"What is there to write?" replies the man. "It’s so obvious!" Note that this is precisely a situation where the man is trying to make common knowledge something he assumes his "readers" already know.) The kicker is that, to prevent something from becoming common knowledge, all you need to do is censor the common-knowledge-producing mechanisms: the press, the Internet, public meetings. This nicely explains why despots throughout history have been so obsessed with controlling the press, and also explains how it’s possible for 10% of a population to murder and enslave the other 90% (as has happened again and again in our species’ sorry history), even though the 90% could easily overwhelm the 10% by acting in concert. Finally, it explains why believers in the Enlightenment project tend to be such fanatical absolutists about free speech. https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/23/can-things-be-both-popular-and-silenced/

As a result, the crowds are now bigger and madder. And our brains, which are finely tuned to listen to the crowd (meaning the tribe or village ala Dunbar’s number), are overwhelmed when the crowd is in the thousands or millions. We should discount signals which come at the cost of a tweet but we can’t and so the pressures to conform are intense. If your job isn’t protected, stay off social media or at least use a pseudonym.

> First, the fact that metrics have momentum means the company is always in one of two modes. When the metrics are up and to the right, the company is in peace mode. When they start to stall, the company is in war mode. A rapidly growing company is by definition in peace mode, and you must act the appropriate part. When the money is flowing, everything is expanding and everyone is happy, nobody wants to hear doomsayers, even if the prophecies will eventually come true. It doesn't matter if the company "doesn't have a culture of blame"— bad news always implies there is someone to blame. So in the upper echelons the flow of negative information is controlled extremely carefully.
> Of course you can't seem like you never deliver bad news either. It's a matter of packaging. Bad news is never individualized. If you ever carelessly imply that some team may be doing something poorly, you will make yourself a target for every opportunist in the company. Instead, bad news is always delivered in general terms and always as a matter of slight adjustments to a continuous variable, never as a binary switch.

In 1986, the founder of NED, Carl Gershman, said the group was created because "it would be terrible for democratic groups around the world to be seen as subsidized by the CIA." Today, instead of receiving CIA money, they receive NED money.

> We saw this happen so often that we made up a name for it: playing house. Eventually I realized why it was happening. The reason young founders go through the motions of starting a startup is because that's what they've been trained to do for their whole lives up to that point.

What difference did it make if other manufacturers could offer DOS too? The result of that miscalculation was an explosion of inexpensive PC clones. Microsoft now owned the PC standard, and the customer. And the microcomputer business ended up being Apple vs Microsoft. Basically, Apple bumped IBM and then Microsoft stole its wallet. - http://www.paulgraham.com/re.html
> So if you change your sales conversations just a little from "do you want to buy our product?" to "what do you need that you'd pay a lot for?" you may find it's suddenly a lot easier to extract money from customers. - http://paulgraham.com/pinch.html
> It's much easier to sell services than a product, just as it's easier to make a living playing at weddings than by selling recordings. But the margins are greater on products. - http://www.paulgraham.com/bronze.html
> Trevor Blackwell presents the following recipe for a startup: "Watch people who have money to spend, see what they're wasting their time on, cook up a solution, and try selling it to them. It's surprising how small a problem can be and still provide a profitable market for a solution." - http://www.paulgraham.com/bronze.html
> One of the most valuable things my father taught me is an old Yorkshire saying: where there's muck, there's brass. Meaning that unpleasant work pays. And more to the point here, vice versa. Work people like doesn't pay well, for reasons of supply and demand. The most extreme case is developing programming languages, which doesn't pay at all, because people like it so much they do it for free.

growth trumps almost everything
> In a rapidly growing market, you don't worry too much about efficiency. It's more important to grow fast. If there's some mundane problem getting in your way, and there's a simple solution that's somewhat expensive, just take it and get on with more important things. EBay didn't win by paying less for servers than their competitors. - http://paulgraham.com/unions.html

But if you had put a gun to my head and said “Don’t scratch yourself, or I’ll kill you”, I would have sat on my hands and suffered quietly. For Bryan, an itch is just a newfound preference for scratching yourself. Shingles, like depression or ADHD, is just a preference shift, and so doesn’t qualify as a real disease.

> They advanced an essentially psychological explanation for why so many college students were suddenly acting simultaneously like fragile snowflakes and rabid authoritarians: thanks to the embrace of the "self-esteem" movement and "helicopter-parenting" by their Boomer parents, along with liability risk-aversion by institutions, young people had grown up physically and psychologically "coddled" and therefore emotionally fragile. By this the authors specifically meant that they had adopted a number of beliefs totally inverse to the Stoic-derived principles considered best practice by modern Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. These unhealthy beliefs included: always trusting your feelings, assuming disagreement is always a personal attack, and believing hurtful words lead to real harm, including permanent trauma. Normalization of these beliefs led to a "cult of safety" on campuses, with hyper-attention devoted to the prevention of offense (because it was now actual "violence").

The survivors would say that it sucked a lot that their families had just been killed, but wouldn’t seem very emotional about it, or really confess to having "trauma" as classically understood. The therapists would say this was very bad, and they were keeping all of their emotions "bottled up", and they really had to "let it out" or else it would fester and they would end up with PTSD. The refugees, who were never exactly clear which sets of white people were giving out free food and which ones weren’t, figured they ought to do what these people wanted in case they were the free food ones.

> it studiously avoids the possibility that some people who talk about their mental illnesses online don’t really have them. I’m not specifically talking about simple fraud and lies, which I suspect are rare, but rather the weird combination of hypochondria, Munchausen’s syndrome, and social contagion that we see all around us in these spaces. Spend any time at all in these communities on Tumblr or Tik Tok and you will find many people, most of them young, who are using mental illness as a means to self-define, to differentiate themselves from the hordes of other people they see online who are just like them.
> And I don’t know how we confront the spiraling number of people claiming to have illnesses for which there are no objective tests without being frank about the existence of hypochondria, Munchausen’s, and psychosomatic illness - particularly when people insist on deepening the social incentives by giving the sick more and more attention.
> Young people understand the allure of being seen; they don’t yet understand the horror of being frozen in other people’s gazes. They don’t understand the costs of being defined.

> If we told people that fear of flying was something everyone struggles with, that it was the result of what others have done to them, or structural racism or whatever, I’m sure we’d get more of it. Imagine further if TV, music, and movies taught kids that fear of flying made them deep and interesting, and schools and universities had fear of flying awareness weeks. This is pretty much the modern approach to mental illness.
> A series of data points converge on the idea that navel-gazing and the medicalization of things like anxiety and depression are themselves major causes of the conditions they are meant to fight. I see nothing else that can explain why we see such skyrocketing rates of mental illness among young people today. If it’s all explained by the rise of the internet, one needs to explain why the mental health crisis hits liberals so much harder than conservatives.
> The mental health module could be excused if it led to positive outcomes. But I don’t think it does. I believe that it crowds out superior frames through which to understand the human psyche, ones that form the basis of myth, ritual, and religion and have withstood the test of time. The language of medicalization – bureaucratic, self-pitying, distant, and sterile – crowds out the language of virtue, which has the power to move people.
> Think about a friend who is acting pathologically risk averse by being too afraid to do something you know that they should do. You can tell them “stop being a wimp,” and that gives them agency. The framing is judgmental – there is a right and wrong way to behave, and you are incentivizing them to make the correct choice. In contrast, a medicalized way of understanding the problem relegates your friend to the status of helpless observer, provides no immediate psychic penalty for doing the wrong thing, and prioritizes one’s current emotional state and immediate comfort over the action ultimately taken, when simply taking the action itself has the potential to change one’s inner condition for the better.
