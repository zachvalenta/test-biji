But people who left big cities were moving to smaller cities, particularly in states with lower income taxes.

> Great cities attract ambitious people. You can sense it when you walk around one. In a hundred subtle ways, the city sends you a message: you could do more; you should try harder.
> How much does it matter what message a city sends? Empirically, the answer seems to be: a lot. You might think that if you had enough strength of mind to do great things, you'd be able to transcend your environment. Where you live should make at most a couple percent difference. But if you look at the historical evidence, it seems to matter more than that.

how construction costs work and how they influence innovation in the industry https://austinvernon.site/blog/construction.html
* construction materials cheap relative to transport costs = manufactured close to sites = lack of scale in manufacturing
* prefab limited geographically due to transport costs = same lack of scale in manufacturing
> New construction in the US is a little over $100 per square foot. Trailers cost $50-$60 per square foot. Cost savings come from cheap finishes and labor savings from manufacturing, while transportation costs are higher. Manufacturing plants are spread across the country to reduce transportation. This limits scale, so the process inside the factory is similar to a site-built home. It is not a factory full of robots. A factory might only build three homes a week. Models that have upgraded finishes are comparable in cost to new construction after site costs. 
* consumer taste = specialization = lack of scale
> People are obsessed with houses. Houses are a part of identity and status. There is near-universal derision for housing that is uniform and cookie cutter.
* stick frame construction aka light-frame aka balloon framing
> No cost dominates the cost of new home construction. It is all nickels and dimes
> Almost every advancement in construction is small enough for a man to carry: 2x4s, nails, power tools, standard 4'x8' OSB sheathing, 4'x8' drywall, ZIP Sheathing, PEX piping. Each advancement fits within a simple construction system. Any complex attempt at prefab or modular, including by Toyota itself, has failed to reach any significant market share.

In the rest of the country, the geography is less fundamentally promising, and Amtrak is contracting to use tracks that are owned by freight.

> You’ll find democratic socialists denouncing gasoline tax increases everywhere they’re proposed. In the abstract, these people will often praise the Nordic social model. But in Sweden, the gas tax is nearly $2.50 a gallon, which not only raises revenue but helps explain why Stockholm has such high mass transit ridership for a city of its size.

* _induced demand_: building more roads leads people to driving farther e.g. LA https://www.slowboring.com/p/roads-and-bridges
> Los Angeles, for example, has now built about 97 track-miles of LA Metro Rail, which is only a tiny bit shorter than the Chicago L. But almost nobody rides. And, yes, that’s the history of the city’s built environment — but the ridership figures are comically low. The Lyon Metro is only 20 miles long, serves a metro area with less than a third of LA County’s population, and has double the daily ridership. There’s something fundamentally ill-conceived about a project that involves that much building for so little actual usage. Some of those are problems with route selection, but the biggest issue is that even as Los Angeles built out their transit infrastructure, they didn’t change land use policy to encourage dense development near the stations...If you’re actually being smart about your project selection and land use, then more transit spending is incredibly valuable. But the lesson of LA Metro, to me, is that you can’t just brute force yourself into transit usage by spending a lot of money. People aren’t going to ride the train just because you would prefer there to be fewer cars on the road. It happens either if people are too poor to afford cars (not the case in the United States) or else if it’s a convenient way to get someplace that has scarce and expensive parking. Without that land use alignment, it’s pointless. https://www.slowboring.com/p/roads-and-bridges

> By now, the story of the homeowning class is well-known — how the U.S. decided to make housing, especially suburban housing, the engine of middle-class wealth, how policies like single-family zoning kept Black Americans from sharing in that wealth, how the shift to knowledge industries created a boom in demand for urban living that created a huge windfall for strategically located homeowners, how those homeowners dominate local politics and prevent the building of new rental housing supply to meet the new demand.

* low density near transit = lower ridership

> Suppose a Chinese person has just the previous day learned the English word "president", and now wants to write it from memory. How to start? Anyone with a year or two of English experience is going to have a host of clues and spelling rules-of-thumb, albeit imperfect ones, to help them along. The word really couldn't start with anything but "pr", and after that a little guesswork aided by visual memory ("Could a 'z' be in there? That's an unusual letter, I would have noticed it, I think. Must be an 's'...") should produce something close to the target...now imagine that you, a learner of Chinese, have just the previous day encountered the Chinese word for "president" (总统) and want to write it. What processes do you go through in retrieving the word? Well, very often you just totally forget, with a forgetting that is both absolute and perfect in a way few things in this life are. You can repeat the word as often as you like; the sound won't give you a clue as to how the character is to be written. After you learn a few more characters and get hip to a few more phonetic components, you can do a bit better. (总 is a phonetic component in some other character, right?...Song? Zeng? Oh yeah, 聪 as in 聪明.") Of course, the phonetic aspect of some characters is more obvious than that of others, but many characters, including some of the most high-frequency ones, give no clue at all as to their pronunciation. 📝 Moser hard
> Just how phonetic the language is a very complex issue. Educated opinions range from 25% (Zhao Yuanren) to around 66% (DeFrancis), though the latter estimate assumes more knowledge of phonetic components than most learners are likely to have. One could say that Chinese is phonetic in the way that sex is aerobic: technically so, but in practical use not the most salient thing about it. 📝 Moser hard
> "What about spelling bees?" a Chinese friend reminds me. "Don’t such contests show that English orthography is also difficult?" To which I reply: Yes, exactly! Spelling bees are challenging and interesting (to some, anyway) precisely because English spelling is so irregular and exception-ridden.  Spelling bees would be pointless in a language with a more regular orthography, such as Spanish...However, it is important to remember that for school children, there is an enormous difference between not knowing how to spell a word and not knowing how to write a character..."I put a sin on the door that says do not disterb"...The writing system she is using is very forgiving of her spelling mistakes, because the mistakes still serve to convey the sounds of her intended sentence.
* even to native speakers (提笔忘字)
> And you're sunk whether your native language is Chinese or not; contrary to popular myth, Chinese people are not born with the ability to memorize arbitrary squiggles. In fact, one of the most gratifying experiences a foreign student of Chinese can have is to see a native speaker come up a complete blank when called upon to write the characters for some relatively common word...I have seen highly literate Chinese people forget how to write certain characters in common words like "tin can", "knee", "screwdriver", "snap"...And when I say "forget", I mean that they often cannot even put the first stroke down on the paper. Can you imagine a well- educated native English speaker totally forgetting how to write a word like "knee" or "tin can"? 📝 Moser hard
> Everything went fine till she came to the characters for “key”, yaoshi 钥匙. She suddenly couldn’t remember how to write them...Xiao Wang simply shrugged and tossed away the uncompleted note. "Never mind," she said. "I’ll just give the key to him when he comes back this evening."
>  I found that I couldn’t write the character ti (嚏) in the word for "sneeze" (打喷嚏) and so I asked my three friends for help. To my amazement, none of the three could successfully retrieve the character ti. Three Chinese graduate students at China's most prestigious university could not write the word for "sneeze" in their own native script!
>  I begin to quiz the class on common words for body parts and everyday objects, and within a few minutes we came up with a list of words like (again) yaoshi 钥匙 "key", niaochao 鸟巢 "bird's nest", lajiao 辣椒 "hot pepper"...all of which they could write (or correctly guess) in English, but could not successfully render in Chinese script...This gave rise to a lively discussion, during which we found that many of the parents, to their bemused chagrin, also stumbled over characters in common words like saozhou 扫帚 "broom", gebozhou 胳膊肘 "elbow"...many of these adults held advanced degrees, and one was an editor at a Beijing newspaper.
* native speakers don't realize it
> What was even more amazing⎯and puzzling⎯was that the Chinese people I dealt with showed almost no concern for this phenomenon. Most tended to explain away the situation as due to low educational standards, or merely natural everyday memory lapses. "And besides," they would say to me, "Don’t you sometimes forget how to spell a word in English?" And I slowly began to realize that part of the problem is that, for most native Chinese, who have not grown up using an alphabetic system of writing, the contrast between the systems is not at all evident⎯they simply have no basis of comparison.
* literacy does not mean the same thing in Chinese (or in Indonesia) https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/03/shruti-rajagopalan-podcast-with-lant-pritchett.html
> Despite being technically among the ranks of the "literate", she is unable to wield the written script with the same ease and fluency as that of her alphabet-using Western counterparts of a comparable educational level. And for this reason “literacy” in the Chinese contexts tends to be defined as the ability to recognize x number of characters, rather than the ability to write them. In the Chinese context, the gap between passive recognition and active production of written symbols is relatively enormous.
* the computer saved written Chinese
> It is an historical fact that the computer saved the Chinese writing system as a viable orthography. It would not have continued to survive in a world of teletypes and typewriters.  
>  Dictionary lookup in Chinese is relatively straightforward - if you already know how to pronounce the character in question, and if you are thoroughly versed in pinyin. When the character is unfamiliar, and you cannot be sure how it is pronounced (which is most of the time), you are probably in for an annoying steeplechase.
* especially mobile computing
> First of all, despite the computer’s ubiquitous presence, the vast majority of daily writing of characters is done by hand. Sales of pencils and pens have not gone down. Jotting notes to oneself, taking notes in class or at a meeting, writing a shopping list, etc. all involve the same process that has been used for thousands of years, and this is not going to change very much in the foreseeable future. Although the computer is now considered virtually indispensable for processing long documents, scribbling something quickly by hand on a piece of paper is still far and away the most common way of getting language into written form.
* pinyin worked
> Her ability at writing Chinese characters by hand confers no advantage at all to her on the computer. On top of the same skills of computer literacy that my mother had to master, she would also have to contend with the byzantine intricacies of Chinese character entry, all of which is alien and new to her. Not being comfortable with pinyin, she would have enormous difficulty entering the characters.
* determinism?
> When I wished to write the Chinese for “sneeze” that day at Peking University, ultimately the note did not get written. And here lies the problem with assessing this situation. While it is relatively easy to measure instances of what does occur, it is difficult to assess the scope of what doesn’t occur. Yet this problem is no more illusory for its "invisibility" - the problem is quite real. The question is, how much communication is lost?
> The result is that to this day, the vast majority of non-fiction books published in China do not have an index, or anything like it...removing indexes from Western library books would be like an atomic bomb being dropped into academia...First we must ask, how should the index be ordered? The obvious method these days would be pinyin rather than the nightmarishly frustrating character radical ordering...including both the characters and their pinyin romanization increases the size of the index considerably
* invisible
> Several years ago a Taiwanese friend mine, a Ph.D. in the Harvard School of Education, lamented to me, "You know, after ten years in the US, I feel sad that I’ve almost lost the ability to write in Chinese. Nowadays it’s so agonizing for me to pick up a pen and compose a letter in Chinese, that I’ve almost stopped writing to my friends. If they have email, we often just write to each other in English. I kept a diary when I first came here, but that’s fallen by the wayside. There are all kinds of subtleties I would love to express in my native language, but it feels like swimming through molasses to write the characters." Letters don’t get written, emotions don’t get expressed. How can one characterize this loss? We might compare this situation to the time lost due to traffic jams. Imagine a utopian Star Trek world in which workers could be instantaneously "beamed" to their place of work, thus avoiding the countless hours stuck in traffic. Is there any doubt that productivity would be significantly higher than it is now? Can anyone estimate how many more pieces of software could be written, how many more medicines developed, or how many points added to the GNP? And consider the inactivity of people who avoid leaving the house at all because they don’t want to enter into the fray of traffic? The cumulative effect of the Chinese writing system acts like a 24-hour information traffic jam, wasting incalculable person-hours and discouraging active participation from the less die-hard users. And as with traffic jams, society still functions, people manage to be productive and learn to adjust to the hassle, and the problem remains largely invisible.

* hard in an absolute sense 📝 Moser hard
> What I mean is that Chinese is not only hard for us (English speakers), but it's also hard in absolute terms. Which means that Chinese is also hard for them, for Chinese people.
> Those who undertake to study the language for any other reason than the sheer joy of it will always be frustrated by the abysmal ratio of effort to effect. Those who are actually attracted to the language precisely because of its daunting complexity and difficulty will never be disappointed. Whatever the reason they started, every single person who has undertaken to study Chinese sooner or later asks themselves "Why in the world am I doing this?" Those who can still remember their original goals will wisely abandon the attempt then and there, since nothing could be worth all that tedious struggle. Those who merely say "I've come this far — I can't stop now" will have some chance of succeeding, since they have the kind of mindless doggedness and lack of sensible overall perspective that it takes.

writing system 📝 Moser hard
> [on the writing system] Beautiful, complex, mysterious — but ridiculous.
* literacy by most common characters/words is the wrong way to measure
> "you really only need 2,000 or so to read a newspaper"...this fairy tale is promulgated because of the fact that, when you look at the character frequencies, over 95% of the characters in any newspaper are easily among the first 2,000 most common ones. But what such accounts don't tell you is that there will still be plenty of unfamiliar words made up of those familiar characters...plus, as anyone who has studied any language knows, you can often be familiar with every single word in a text and still not be able to grasp the meaning. Reading comprehension is not simply a matter of knowing a lot of words; one has to get a feeling for how those words combine with other words in a multitude of different contexts. In addition, there is the obvious fact that even though you may know 95% of the characters in a given text, the remaining 5% are often the very characters that are crucial for understanding the main point of the text. A non-native speaker of English reading an article with the headline "JACUZZIS FOUND EFFECTIVE IN TREATING PHLEBlTIS" is not goingto get very far if they don't know the words "jacuzzi" or"phlebitis".
* literacy rates between languages are not equal
> The problem of reading is often a touchy one for those in the China field. How many of us would dare stand up in front of a group of colleagues and read a randomly-selected passage out loud? Yet inferiority complexes or fear of losing face causes many teachers and students to become unwitting cooperators a kind of conspiracy of silence wherein everyone pretends that after four years of Chinese the diligent student should be whizzing through anything from Confucius to Lu Xun, pausing only occasionally to look up some pesky low- frequency character (in their Chinese-Chinese dictionary, of course). Others, of course, are more honest about the difficulties. The other day one of my fellow graduate students, someone who has beed studying Chinese for ten years or more, said to me "My research is really hampered by the fact that I still just can't read Chinese. It takes me hours to get through two or three pages, and I can't skim to save my life." This would be an astonishing admission for a tenth-year student of, say, French literature.
> The comparison with learning the usual western languages is striking. After about a year of studying French, I was able to read a lot. I went through the usual kinds of novels — La nausée by Sartre, Voltaire's Candide, L'étranger by Camus
> Imagine the kind of task faced by the average Chinese adult who decides to study English. What skills are needed to master the writing system? That's easy: 26 letters...how long does it take this Chinese learner of English to master the various components of the English writing system? Maybe a day or two. Now consider the American undergraduate who decides to study Chinese. What does it take for this person to master the Chinese writing system?...it depends on how you define "component" (strokes? radicals?), plus a lot of other tedious details. Suffice it to say, the number is quite large, vastly more than the 26 letters of the Roman alphabet. And how are these components combined to form characters? Well, you name it — components to the left of other components, to the right of other components, on top of other components, surrounding other components, inside of other components—almost anything is possible....how long does it take a Westerner to learn the Chinese writing system so that when confronted with any new character they at least know how to move the pen around in order to produce a reasonable facsimile of that character? Again, hard to say, but I would estimate that it takes the average learner several months of hard work to get the basics down. Maybe a year or more if they're a klutz who was never very good in art class. Meanwhile, their Chinese counterpart learning English has zoomed ahead to learn cursive script, with time left over to read Moby Dick, or at least Strunk & White.
* no cognates
> I remember when I had been studying Chinese very hard for about three years, I had an interesting experience. One day I happened to find a Spanish-language newspaper sitting on a seat next to me...Having never studied a day of Spanish, I could read a Spanish newspaper more easily than I could a Chinese newspaper after more than three years of studying Chinese.

classical
> Whereas modern Mandarin is merely perversely hard, classical Chinese is deliberately irnpossible. Here's a secret that sinologists won't tell you: A passage in classical Chinese can be understood only if you already know what the passage says in the first place. This is because classical Chinese really consists of several centuries of esoteric anecdotes and in-jokes written in a kind of terse, miserly code for dissemination arnong a small, elite group of intellectually-inbred bookworrns who already knew the whole literature backwards and forwards, anyway. An uninitiated westerner can no more be expected to understand such writing than Confucius himself, if transported to the present, could understand the entries in the "personal" section of the classified ads that say things like: "Hndsm. SWGM, 24, 160, sks BGM or WGM for gentle S&M, mod. bndg., some lthr., twosm or threesm ok, have own equip., wheels, 988-8752 lv. mssg. on ans. mach., no weirdos please."

Because English fluency frequently helps them get good jobs, meet interesting people, and enjoy culture. Pretty obvious, right? To understand why Americans don’t learn foreign languages, simply reverse this reasoning. We don’t learn foreign languages because foreign languages rarely helps us get good jobs, meet interesting people, or enjoy culture. Americans start in an unusually abundant and diverse economic, social, and cultural pool, so we have little reason to stray. And if Americans do decide to sample other pools, we can literally travel the world without needing to learn a word of another language. I may sound like a typical philistine economist. So let me confess that I personally got a lot of value out of my two years of college German. I’m an opera fan; knowing a bit of German enhances my experience.

> The spectacle is not a collection of images; it is a social relation between people that is mediated by images.
> "In all of its particular manifestations — news, propaganda, advertising, entertainment — the spectacle represents the dominant model of life."... Girardian mimetic desire is triangular; there is you (the desirer), the object (of desire), and the model (another person who also desires the object)...Before the spectacle, your models, mentors, and rivals were real people you knew in real life.  Now we have an acronym for that - IRL - because reality is everywhere in retreat.

text vs. oral https://niccolo.substack.com/p/the-dubrovnik-interviews-marc-andreessen
> This is a very old and very important debate that traces back to classical Greece. Socrates himself was famously on the other side of your position, an Oral Supremacist versus your Text Supremacist. Socrates argued that text is markedly inferior to oral information conveyance, precisely because text can't interact, it can't talk back. He predicted that a future of text would stultify cultural development and the transmission of virtue, to which [waves hands and points in all directions]. Later, media theorist Walter Ong articulated the profound differences between Textual (Literate) and Oral cultures. Textual cultures are abstract, analytical, mathematical, clinical, universalist. Oral cultures are grounded, intuitive, emotional, interpersonal, group oriented. I think this maps to what Vilfredo Pareto and James Burnham described as "combinations" and "group-persistences", which also maps to what we know today as libs and cons. Yes, I just called you a lib. Sorry. And then anthropolgist Joseph Henrich in his ultra-important new book "The WEIRDest People In The World" shows how growing up in a Textual culture literally changes your brain's physical structure; your brain reallocates processing power normally devoted to analyzing faces to processing text. Which explains a LOT.
> But also, you have a medium like Twitter, which Antonio Garcia-Martinez argues is actually Oral masquerading as Textual -- on Twitter, you think you're reading and writing text, but you're actually absorbing and spitting Oral fire.
> But interestingly, Clubhouse, at least so far, is nicer than Twitter -- conversations on politically loaded topics that would instantly collapse into all out warfare on Twitter can sustain for many hours on Clubhouse, tense but not explosive. Why is that? Draw a two by two grid, with "Active and Passive" on one axis and "Approve and Disapprove" on the other. Twitter has three of the four boxes filled: Retweets are Active Approval, Likes are Passive Approval, Quote-Retweets are Active Disapproval (dunking). But Twitter is missing Passive Disapproval -- in person you can Passively Disapprove with a glance, a sound, a motion, but there's no equivalent mechanism on Twitter. But on Clubhouse you have several ways to Passively Disapprove -- you can vocalize a sound or go silent, you can leave the stage, and you can leave the room. The reputationally-homicidal battle arena of Twitter has its place, but there should also be a setting to talk about important topics without getting an RPG up your virtual tailpipe, and hopefully Clubhouse is it.

> The role that many blogs played as aggregators of interesting content has also been largely eclipsed by social media and RSS reader feeds
> The problem is that the basic incentive structure behind internet publishing has changed. Somewhere in the late aughts, writing online became a respectable thing to do. Professors are advised to publicize their findings through blog posts and online editorials; think tank fellows have learned to condense their policy recommendations into internet sized articles. Writing a few policy op-eds for online platforms like War on the Rocks has become a rite of passage for ambitious M.A students in security and area studies. The old strategy blogosphere that was dominated by outsiders to Washington has been replaced by one dominated by writers from inside the beltway.
> A junior officer who decided to take his views online in 2005 did so knowing that it might hurt his career; an M.A. student who decides to bring his views online in 2015 does in hopes it will help his career. Much of what is published in forums like War on the Rocks, The Diplomat, The National Interest, or Foreign Policy would never be written if its authors did not know it would directly boost their career goals and social profile.

> Australia proposed that if any link to a news site appears on Google or Facebook, the news site has to be paid. The platforms are not allowed to refuse to link (meanwhile newspapers have always been free to remove their pages from Google). The price is to be set by an arbitrator; the news companies demanded at least 10% of total G&FB Australian ad revenue, on the basis that they think news is 10% of G&FB traffic. Of course, if you follow that principle then G&FB would pay out 100% of revenue to content they link, and would not exist. Ben Evans newsletter 375 2021.02.16

* narrowcasting = pathologization of everything
> Teenagers today are raised with narrowcasting and sub-tribes. Social media allows people who feel strange or alienated in any way (i.e. all teens) to “find their sub-tribe,” which can be helpful. But social media also allows those sub-tribes to be closed feedback loops suffering from epistemic closure, explaining away all inconvenient facts and validating all the behavior of their fellow tribe members, no matter how bad. They find themselves thinking that all their teenage problems are explained by the fact that they’re LGBTQ, or that all their teenage problems are the fault of non-whites, when in fact they’re just common problems shared by most teens. It must be nice to spend much of your turbulent teen years in, effectively, an online support group; on the other hand, it must make living in the real world, with all its complexities and people different from yourself, unfathomable. https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/yes-this-is-the-face-of-a-tyrant

## audio/radio

podcasts
> I don’t want to be interviewed about my life and opinions. My life is a combination of boring and private. My opinions on most topics are “I haven’t researched this yet; give me six hours and I might be able to say something intelligent”, “Sorry, I researched this for six hours but I haven’t learned anything that makes me deviate from the consensus position on it yet”, and “Here’s what I wrote in my blog post on this”. I constantly hear about podcast-related drama where someone interviewed a person who platformed a person who went on a podcast with Hitler and now everyone hates everyone involved. I don’t want to have to keep track of what podcasts Hitler went on, or denounce people who had the wrong guests on their podcast. I find everything about this tedious. Podcasting combines all the most awkward and nerve-wracking features of TV debates, public speaking, making phone calls, and getting cancelled on Twitter. It’s a form of media almost perfectly optimized to make me hate it. I will not go on your podcast. Stop asking me to do this. https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/from-the-mailbag

> The auditory techniques and the verbal tics of Glass and his team (the long pauses, the squirrelly delivery, the uptalk?) have been so widely adopted that it’s hard to recall how radical they once sounded. Writing in the Times Magazine in 1999, the journalist Marshall Sella described Glass’s on-air presence as “uncomfortably intimate.” Today, it has become a podcast cliché for the host, however well versed in his subject, to display an air of naïveté, and for the audio to incorporate mundanities of the reporting process. - https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/19/how-podcasts-became-a-seductive-and-sometimes-slippery-mode-of-storytelling

* replace podcasts with talks
> Also, if you have an interest, next time we're both home I can set up your computer with the macOS package manager, which will allow you to download things from Youtube. This can be valuable for replacing podcasts. Many authors of serious non-fiction will do talks after publication and you can approximate reading the book via grabbing the audio from Youtube. I'd argue for many books that are not literary non-fiction (e.g. John McPhee, Zadie Smith) these discussions serve in better stead than the book itself, though the best non-literary non-fiction authors must be read (e.g. Ward Farnsworth, Paul Graham). Substituting artifacts of research based on a timelines broader than "what happened this week that I should be emotional about?" in place of podcasts is the intellectual equivalent of eating kale when everyone else is buying Twinkies. Not that there aren't good podcasts, and some that don't manage both novelty and historical scope, but couching consumption in things exclusively concerned with and produced by the immediate grounds of everything else being produced makes it very difficult to have mental flexibility; examining a situation and have 4-5 manuveurs of "what if X?" instead of simply your side and the opposition.

> Low-cost, ubiquitous RSS-based distribution of podcasts is doubtlessly responsible for the medium’s growth to date. Without it, it would have been too hard to find Pod Save America or Serial, to share episodes and to build podcasting habits. But RSS is also a limiter. The RSS standard allows for only a single version of a file to be distributed (which cannot be updated) and almost no audience-side data is returned. This means there’s no detailed listener or listening data (where the audience skipped, whether they completed a file, etc.), no potential for dynamic ad insertion or programmatic advertising and no interactivity. This might not seem like a big deal if you’re a podcast fan today, but the evolution of mobile-phone messaging is an interesting case study. 
> This new feature breaks RSS and requires Spotify-based distribution, both of which have downsides. But it also makes podcasts a far more powerful medium for content creation, listening, and discovery. This required not just integration into a closed platform, but one that already delivered music digitally and on-demand, via subscription, and with a baked-in rights/royalty management system. All of this required technology that didn’t exist 15 years ago.

Indeed, I think they project their tendency to follow trusted sources onto the listeners. Someone who takes daily marching orders from a few publications naturally assumes that a podcast consumer lives similarly, that Joe is speaking some gospel, followed in lockstep. But that’s not quite how this all works. You read that Joe Rogan is "trusted" by a certain cohort but I don’t think that’s accurate. He’s liked.

financial viability
> France has fined Google €500m for not negotiating ‘in good faith’ to pay newspapers whenever a link to their sites appears in search. Of course, if the French were in good faith then the newspapers would be paying, so what next? The underlying reasoning is very simple and make perfect sense, if you’ve never used the internet or thought much about how it works: “Newspapers have to be on Google and FB, but G&FB need them as well for completeless, and G&FB’s market power means the newspapers can’t demand payment for this. So, this is a competition problem”. Sure, except that 1: no-one else pays to make a link either (I don’t, and I have no market power) and 2: why should it only be newspapers that get paid, and not the other 99% of links that show up in search results? The financial viability of news is indeed an important social and political question, but that doesn’t mean it’s a competition question. If you think there should be a subsidy, and a tax, you should be honest and do that, not fabricate imaginary economic arguments. The trouble is, taxes and subsidies would break all sorts of trade agreements, but if you pretend it’s a competition issue you can try to avoid the rules. - Ben Evans 21.07.19

> it also created expansive pressures to describe more and more things without any ambiguity and shading, and judge more and more right-wing claims pre-emptively. Which is only a good rule for a truth-seeking profession if you assume the day will never come when Tom Cotton has a point.

> Journalists and their editors carry with them a set of a priori beliefs on what is actually important (“newsworthy”).
> It was a shock on arriving at the New York Times in 2004, as the paper’s movie editor, to realize that its editorial dynamic was essentially the reverse. By and large, talented reporters scrambled to match stories with what internally was often called “the narrative.” We were occasionally asked to map a narrative for our various beats a year in advance, square the plan with editors, then generate stories that fit the pre-designated line.
> Journalists resist this message. They have so long internalized that their role is "speaking truth to power” that they fail to see when they are the power. So let me be explicit: if you have a staff position at the New York Times you are the power. When you are writing for that paper you have the power to determine what millions of people will think about an individual, movement, or event. You have the power to decide the first thing people will find when they Google search your subject—forever. That is power. If every piece you file does not have you in awe at your own responsibility, you are doing this wrong. Unless your subject sits atop a corporate hierarchy, is an elected politician, an appointed high official, a commanding general, has a net worth of more than $5 million, or a loyal following with similar numbers, then your critical coverage is “punching down.” That is simply the nature of the institution you work for.

> But we don’t just want people to read our work. We want people to spread our work — to be so moved by what we wrote or said that they log on to Facebook and share it with their friends or head over to Reddit and try to tell the world. That’s how you get those dots to multiply. But people don’t share quiet voices. They share loud voices. They share work that moves them, that helps them express to their friends who they are and how they feel. Social platforms are about curating and expressing a public-facing identity. They’re about saying, “I’m a person who cares about this, likes that, and loathes this other thing.” They are about signaling the groups you belong to and, just as important, the groups you don’t belong to.
> But cumulatively, it’s a sharp change from the days in which most political content people saw was self-consciously trying to avoid offending anyone. The stories that thrive when your business model is a local monopoly that needs a news product that’s appealing to every kind of person who might shop at a department store are different from the stories that thrive when your business model is people who strongly agree with your stories sharing them with their friends.

* newsworthiness [Klein https://www.vox.com/2020/1/28/21077888/why-were-polarized-media-book-ezra-news]
> “Journalism academics have always known that newsworthiness, as the American press defines it, isn’t a system with any coherence to it,” Jay Rosen, a journalism professor at New York University, told me. “It doesn’t make any sense. It’s just a list of factors that occasionally come together to produce news. There’s no real logic to it, other than it’s a list of things that can make something news. The advantage of it is that it leaves maximum leeway for editors to say, ‘This is news,’ and, ‘That’s not news,’ and so it’s news if a journalist decides it’s news.” In practice, judgments of newsworthiness are often contagious; nothing obscures the fact that a decision is being made quite like everyone else making it, too. In the modern era, a shortcut to newsworthiness is social media virality; if people are already talking about a story or a tweet, that makes it newsworthy almost by definition.

> It's interesting how many different ways there are not to be earnest: to be cleverly cynical, to be superficially brilliant, to be conspicuously virtuous, to be cool, to be sophisticated, to be orthodox, to be a snob, to bully, to pander, to be on the make. This pattern suggests that earnestness is not one end of a continuum, but a target one can fall short of in multiple dimensions.

Perhaps an email is a piece of tangible value - something that you’re given every week, that you can keep, whereas a blog post disappears in the firehose, and you never remember to visit, and can’t be bothered to log in (and RSS died, and Facebook is a lottery). More practically, while some 'newsletters' are really long-form writing delivered by email, many (like mine or Ben Thompson’s) are actual newsletters, driven by what just happened, which makes keeping up the volume easier - you don’t need to generate a big original idea every day.

Like when people say “I saw this guy with Atlas Shrugged on the subway, it was so cringe.” Literally, what the fuck are you talking about? Have you never imagined reading a book without wanting it to be a signifier of your entire personality? Do you know how many books I’ve read specifically because I hate the author and their outlook? Or, quelle horreur, you could consider reading a book without knowing what you think about it until you’ve read it! You know, the generative state of being open to forming a summative position based on the gradual aggregation of myriad minor judgments formed along the way? That would seem to be a major part of the point of reading. Even if someone outwardly professes to like a book that you don’t, I haven’t got a clue what you think that fact in isolation teaches you. Interests? I have a copy of Be Here Now on my shelf. I’ve never meditated in my life. Intelligence? One of the smartest people I know has a Family Guy tattoo.

> The point of the critic (an insider) ought to be to explain to the outsider why he or she is mistaken or misinformed. My favorite kind of review of anything — book, movie, art — is the one that has as its starting premise: You may not like this. But here is why you should. What I found really valuable, after Macdonald’s death, was not watching his old greatest hits on Youtube. It was reading the eulogies written for him by people who appreciated his genius. The ones in The Ringer and the New York Times were particularly good, because they took precisely this approach. They explained him to people who might never have taken him seriously in the first place. I like this approach way more than criticism that takes as its premise I do not like this. Let me tell you why. How does that help the outsider? As an outsider I don’t need reasons to dismiss something. My ignorance of the subject is already doing a good job of that. I need reasons to take seriously something that I would otherwise dismiss.

> In 1931, the German cultural critic Walter Benjamin wrote an essay called “Unpacking My Library,” describing these relationships with cultural objects. In the essay, Benjamin narrates removing his book collection from dusty crates, untouched for years. The volumes are splayed loose on the floor, “not yet touched by the mild boredom of order,” all set to be rearranged on shelves once more. For Benjamin, the very possession of these books formed his identity as a reader, writer, and human being — even if he hadn’t read all of them. They sat proudly on his shelves as symbols, representing the knowledge that he still aspired to gain or the cities he had traveled, where he encountered a book in a previously unknown shop.

> For the most part, publishers do not sell their e-books or audiobooks to libraries—they sell digital distribution rights to third-party venders, such as OverDrive
> There are a handful of popular e-book venders, including Bibliotheca, Hoopla, Axis 360, and the nonprofit Digital Public Library of America. But OverDrive is the largest. It is the company behind the popular app Libby
> In 2011, HarperCollins introduced a new lending model that was capped at twenty-six checkouts, after which a library would need to purchase the book again.
> For a classic work, which readers were likely to check out steadily for years to come, a library might purchase a handful of expensive perpetual licenses.
> To illustrate the economics of e-book lending, the N.Y.P.L. sent me its January, 2021, figures for “A Promised Land,” the memoir by Barack Obama that had been published a few months earlier by Penguin Random House. At that point, the library system had purchased three hundred and ten perpetual audiobook licenses at ninety-five dollars each, for a total of $29,450, and had bought six hundred and thirty-nine one- and two-year licenses for the e-book, for a total of $22,512. Taken together, these digital rights cost about as much as three thousand copies of the consumer e-book, which sells for about eighteen dollars per copy. As of August, 2021, the library has spent less than ten thousand dollars on two hundred and twenty-six copies of the hardcover edition, which has a list price of forty-five dollars but sells for $23.23 on Amazon. A few thousand people had checked out digital copies in the book’s first three months, and thousands more were on the waiting list.

> To this end, we can point to Spotify’s recent podcasting deal with comic book publisher DC Entertainment. DC’s last audio-native serial ended in 1951, two years after The Lone Ranger premiered on TV and three years after the unofficial start of the TV era (1948’s the Ed Sullivan Show). Of course, one can debate the size of this opportunity at a time in which blockbuster filmmaking and video games are bigger than ever. But what matters is this is a new and net incremental opportunity for audio. Notably, less than 5% of podcast listenership today is narrative fiction. - https://www.matthewball.vc/all/audiotech

> There was a time in which oral culture reigned supreme, which was eventually supplanted by the stage play, which dominated the middle of the second millennium. Later on, the most popular stories in the world were text-based, from Lord of the Rings to the Chronicles of Narnia, then in radio through Gunsmoke and The Lone Ranger, then film, such as Star Wars, Titanic and The Matrix. Eventually, TV became the best medium for love building and incubation. https://www.matthewball.vc/all/what-is-an-entertainment-company-and-why-does-the-answer-matter

film took over from poetry and novels https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2019/10/on-adding-phrases-to-language.html
> The 1950s was the last decade that poets existed as more than a punch-line.
> Who has taken the poets place? It is not the novelists; I strain to find any who have added a catch phrase since Heller penned Catch-22. Nor is it the rappers, singers, and rock-stars that many claimed have replaced poetry in popular life. What actually replaced poetry was film.

> You are not alone in your assessment that Hollywood has gone to pot. Maybe it is a distribution feedback loop? Films still cost more than TV, so studios play it safe, and then writers tailor their work towards serializable stories, producers pitch those works for TV instead of film and we end up with an infantile box office? [to Robo 21.01.21]

> Disney’s theatrically-focused film studio is inarguably the best in the world (it had roughly twice the revenue and three times the margin of the #2 player in 2019). However, Disney’s parks division generated more than twice the revenue and profit of its studio division. Disney’s future, meanwhile, depends on a direct-to-consumer video platform that’s mostly growing through television series not feature films.

> Finally, the key important innovation in streaming video wasn’t how it affected pay TV models or content, but how it created altogether new formats.

* good for knowledge production
> Something like Twitter is kind of amazing. For instance, you write something, you post it. You get immediate feedback from people who are experts about this thing. Immediately people will give you references of other papers that are relevant to what you’re discussing. Whenever a new paper comes out it’s going to be instantly discussed and you’re much more likely to know about it right away. The speed at which relevant information is being transmitted has been increased by a lot by this stuff. I have to believe that this is going to have some effect on the production of knowledge in the long run. Just because of something like Twitter, we’re in a completely different environment with respect to this. It doesn’t just help with stuff like making it easier for people from outside of a given field to make contributions to that field. This is really an underappreciated aspect of that stuff, because people only think about the dumb stuff. https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/actually-twitter-is-real-life

> Add all this together and you are left with a population that found immense pleasure in listening to, reenacting, and reading the speeches of others. It was a prized art, and when masters like Webster or Lincoln displayed their talents, people flocked together to listen to them. There was thus a great deal of patience for the sort of rhetorical flourish inherit in the long discussions of Shakespeare seen above. Today’s Americans will not sit still and listen to a political speech for longer than ten minutes. The medium through which politicians communicate to the masses really doesn’t let them. Radio shows and news channels rely on the soundbite. If a politician’s message cannot be squeezed into a seven second slot it will not be heard. https://scholars-stage.org/shakespeare-in-american-politics/
* avoid impolite people
> Don’t call names. Listen and respond to what people literally say. Don’t personally insult people. Don’t take generalizations personally. If someone’s meaning is unclear, don’t put words his mouth; ask him to clarify. And of course, don’t escalate. If someone’s impolite, the polite response is to end the conversation, not respond in kind. https://www.econlib.org/archives/2017/03/good_manners_vs.html
* avoid bad faith / trolling
> If you want to spread unpopular truth X, you generally need to defend X, not a caricature of X. True, trolling is a good way to get attention and promote in-group solidarity. But it also alienates people who don’t initially agree with you. People who want to spread unpopular truths need to overcome the audience’s hostility, not court it. https://www.econlib.org/archives/2016/04/a_puritanical_v.html
* creates false sense of consensus
> nless you like and admire Cotton and Pompeo and want to be known to the world as a follower of Cotton-Pompeo Thought, it is not very compelling to speak up in favor of a minority viewpoint among scientists. Why spend your day in nasty fights on Twitter when you could be doing science? Then if you secure your impression of what “the scientists” think about something from scanning Twitter, you will perceive a consensus that is not really there. If something is a 70-30 issue but the 30 are keeping their heads down, it can look like a 98-2 issue. https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-medias-lab-leak-fiasco

> 2000s-era "argument culture" to 2010s-era "echo culture". The very early Internet had pro-argument norms; it was your god-given right to march into any blog or forum you wanted and tell the people there why they were wrong. Partly this was the inevitable effect of everyone on the early Internet being the sort of programming nerds willing to try this weird new invention. And partly it came from a utopian philosophy where the Internet was going to be a new medium that united humanity regardless of nation or creed in a great Republic Of The Intellect, or whatever. Maybe it was even partly due to naivete - a lot of people hadn't really met anyone who thought differently from them before, and assumed that changing people’s minds would be really easy. https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/the-rise-and-fall-of-online-culture

Nor do they have the capability to keep such material off of their websites if they wanted to—it would require policing millions of user-posted videos every month. But what if they were held legally liable for the pirated material on their sites? What if they had to pay damages for every instance of revenge porn, every rape video? One questions whether the free-porn model could survive. https://scholars-stage.org/porn-restriction-for-realists/

> Still, the discussion of all of these different networks really does highlight how Facebook is unique: while Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok are all first and foremost about the medium, and only then the network, Facebook is about the network first. That is how the service has evolved from text to images to video and, I wouldn’t be surprised, to audio. This also explains why Facebook managed the shift to mobile so well; for these other networks, meanwhile, it was mobile that was the foundation for their transformative breakthroughs.

> Facebook has close to 2bn users, posting over 100bn things each day. The global SMS system, at its peak, had 20-25bn messages a day. This is not a ‘publisher’, in the sense that a newspaper or radio station are publishers - or if it is, then we’ve stretched the word ‘publisher’ so far as to become meaningless. A human editor chooses ten stories for the front page of a newspaper, and ten stories for the 9 o’clock news, but there is no-one sitting in Menlo Park choosing a hundred photos for your Instagram feed each morning. But on the other hand, a phone company does not write rules about what you can say, and social network do write rules, or try to, and they make decisions about what kinds of things should be in your feed, and why. This is not a publisher, but it’s not a phone company either, nor a restaurant. https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2021/1/17/speech-and-publishing

blogs vs. Twitter https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2020/07/the-world-that-twitter-made.html
> But she also came to America's public sphere late, and never really experienced the world before twitter. That was the public sphere of blogs and forum posts, not tweets and retweets. She can be happy with what she has: she knows of nothing of what was lost.
> Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Medium, Reddit, and Instagram either did not exist then or were the preserve of teenagers and university age students. Those platforms were for flirting and goofing off and gossiping behind your parents back. People who wanted to discuss bigger things—culture, art, history, science, business, politics, or what have you—went to the blogs. Well, the blogs and the forums.
> There were two aspects of this older internet ecology that set it apart from the current get up. The first was its clear division into hundreds of separate communities. This was most explicit in the forums, which usually did not allow users to comment unless they created a log-in and agreed to very specific community rules.
> People thought of themselves as part of a select community. There were many incentives for treating each other as community members should. Because these communities were relatively small and contained, everybody involved was soon familiar with everybody else. There was nothing to be gained but much to be lost by turning disagreements personal.
> This leads to the second big difference between the internet of the aughts and the internet of the 2010s: the standards for participation were different—in some ways the barrier to entry was both higher and lower than on twitter. In the old days people used to say "if you don't like it, make your own blog!" That directive was easy to follow. It is near impossible for someone de-platformed from twitter to create some new twitter to replace it; in contrast, anybody really could create their own blog (and forums were not hard to stand up either).
> But if writers were to have people read their blogs, then their blogs had to be good. This was the price of participation. On twitter, anybody who can think up a snarky 140 characters retort can contribute to the "conversation." In the blogosphere, you had to create your own blog and write up your thoughts in long-form. For this reason, blog debates were simply more intelligent than today's twitter debates. Idiot bloggers were ignored and usually did not last. Idiot tweeters cannot be shunted to the side—especially if they have a blue check.
> The twitter user with 500~ followers in some ways exists in a world similar to the blogosphere of old. She is part of a small, self-selected community. Her followers chose to follow her because they are sympathetic with her ideas or at least interested in them. It is not difficult to have open and honest exchanges when you swim in safe waters. Most people in her network know her, and she knows most of them, so there is little incentive for mischief. This changes with scale. 
> Soon, large numbers of people start to follow because they see you as a representative of a certain strain of thought, or as a key voice in a particular conversation they care about. They are not are sympathetic to your ideas or even merely intellectually interested in them; instead they follow you to keep tabs on what you and people like you are saying. Many actually despise you and your ideas to their core (in twitterese, they are a “hate follow”).
> Twitter's retweet mechanism makes this problem far worse. All one needs is a snarky RT for these people to take what a thought they dislike and BOOM!, project it into communities it was never intended for as the perfect example of what they all should be hating at that moment. Thus if you have a large follower account your experience on twitter goes like this: you share a thought optimized for Group X. Members of Group Y, Group Z, and Group V automatically start sharing it as the textbook example of why Group X deserves crucifixion.

* being polite doesn't help https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/reflections-on-2021
> One thing that used to bother me about academia was how someone would have a critique of a research project that completely discredited it, but nobody would actually follow the argument to its logical conclusion and say the research was therefore worthless and the author should go do something else. We as a society would be better off valuing being correct more and being civil less. Maybe you would ideally want both, but I suspect that there’s actually a tradeoff, as people who tend to be right about a lot are often jerks, and academics who are wrong about everything always seem to be complimenting each other for being stunning and brave
> Another consideration is that people usually say that movements do better when they’re polite, so I may be harming the prospects of the views I advocate for. This always struck me as a belief rooted in social desirability bias, a kind of “nice guys finish first” philosophy. The woke are the most aggressive and least civil and tolerant political faction in the country, and they seem to have had the biggest political impact in the last few years. Trump supporters are the rudest people on the right, and they’re wining on their side. So why do we think civility is good for a movement?

* local government is terrible https://www.econlib.org/you-had-two-jobs/
> Oakeshott suggests that there had been two major modes or understandings of human social organization. In the first, which he calls "enterprise association" (or universitas), the state is understood as imposing some universal purpose (profit, salvation, progress, racial domination) on its subjects. By contrast, "civil association" (or societas) is primarily a legal relationship in which laws impose obligatory conditions of action but do not require choosing one action rather than another. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Oakeshott#On_Human_Conduct_and_Oakeshott's_political_theory
* lack of local control
> 21st century America has lost this ability to organize and solve problems at the local level.
> At the same time many organizations which once gave average men and women the chance to work together or serve in local leadership roles disappeared–or have been consolidated to heights far beyond the reach of the average citizen. There are fewer school boards and municipal governments now than there in the 1950s, despite the doubling of America’s population since then. National charities are more likely to ask their members for money than time; lobbying has replaced supporting local chapters as the main activity of most national activists. The federal government assumes powers traditionally reserved to local and state governments. Local businesses have been pushed out of existence by international conglomerates. [11] The businesses, associations, congregations, and clubs that once made up American society are gone. America has been atomized; her citizens live alone, connected but weakly one to another. Arrayed against each is a set of vast, impersonal bureaucracies that cannot be controlled, only appealed to.
> over the last five decades American social capital has fallen apart. Americans are less likely to volunteer, participate in local political parties or caucuses, join civic, religious, or self improvement associations, attend church, have group hobbies, vote, read local newspapers, organize neighborhood gatherings, play cards, spend time on social visits, or have as many friends now as they did in 1960.

> At the same time, new technologies and resources allowed the association-builders to operate from centralized offices in Washington and New York. Back in the 19th century, when Frances Willard was working to build the nationally influential Woman's Christian Temperance Union, she traveled across the country recruiting organizers to found and sustain a nationwide network of local chapters. By contrast, when Marian Wright Edelman was inspired to launch the Children's Defense Fund, she turned to private foundations for grants and then recruited an expert staff of researchers and lobbyists.

The history of Judaism demonstrates, Haivry argues, that you don’t need a state or a political order to be a nation. https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/scary-future-american-right-national-conservatism-conference/620746/

> Of course, the founders themselves can be assailed in ways similar to the points Pop makes about Columbus. If you’re of a revolutionary spirit, that’s just more wood for your fire, and a guilty plea in history’s court. So, obviously, it all needs to come down. But if you’re reliant on the nation improving in the near term? Rising countries tend to inculcate a sense of pride in their citizenry, making them believe that they are part of a largely positive tradition. Is America a force for good? Perhaps debatable. Can America be healthfully functional if most of its citizens believe it to be evil? Probably not, I’d hazard. The simplest analogies apply here. You’re more likely to take care of a car if you think it’s a nice one.
> It’s funny because I don’t believe in noble lies, and I’m not an especially nationalistic person. I just buy that you must instill some broad sense of positive tradition in a populace, or there’s no real path forward. That doesn’t mean suppressing those who discuss sins of the past, but it does mean refusing to define the past as one big sin. The cosmopolitan among us largely don’t apply this myopic lens to other modern nations and yet we will to our own, when looking back. The favored academic perspective is to be a moral absolutist across time, but relativist across space.

As a society turns developed, its main problems become social: an organizational sclerosis, which no technology is sophisticated enough to solve.

* children of cohabition fare the same as single parents, single parents more often low education/income [164]
* https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/you-should-have-kids
> Hertz argues that since people are having smaller families, we need to ask ourselves how to replace the meaning they used to find in children, siblings, and cousins by encouraging them to find ways “to care for people who are not necessarily linked to them by blood.” To me, this sounds like asking “how can we enjoy eating in a world where we have dulled our sense of taste?” or “how can we enjoy sexual pleasure after we’ve castrated ourselves?” Blood relations, and the pair bonds that help create them, are not one form of social connectedness we can just exchange for something else once we don’t want to bother with the hassle of getting married and making babies anymore. Procreation and family formation are the evolutionary reasons love exists in the first place, and there is little to suggest that we can replace these things through government sponsored initiatives that seek to connect us to those we are not either having sex with or related to.

* social media as substitute
> I suspect a big draw of social media is that it resembles actual human communication while also conferring a lot more control to all parties. Vulnerability is not required. Communication is stripped of almost all of its context, and is often asynchronous. There is little expectation of any sort of real commitment. People are easily muted, unfollowed, and blocked. In sanitizing away the messiness of real relationships, we’re left with an empty shell that puts us more in control and yet also more lonely. It would seem that we cannot simply pick and choose which aspects of relationships we want, nor can we relate to others at the scale that social media enables us to.  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26943140

> Russian friendships are much more emotional and intense than American friendships. When I moved back to this country five and a half years ago, it was like this sense of whiplash because I had a lot of friends here, but I had been absent for 20 years. I would get together with my friends, and then two hours later, our get-together would be over. I’m like, “Well, what was the point of that? Was that just to let each other know that we still exist?” Because you don’t really get into deep conversation until about four hours in and a number of bottles of alcohol... But if you’re going to really get down, it’s like a 3 a.m., 4 a.m. proposition. You can’t just have dinner and go home. Then I realized this was really a way to be very productive because I could go back to work. I write at night. I could work after seeing friends, which was amazing, but something that I have never experienced in Russia. I think that maybe that’s what you’re referring to. Maybe you’re just referring to the emotional intensity of Russian friendship, where it’s hard. It’s like lovers, even in this country, don’t really drift apart usually. You have to break up. You can’t just stop calling, and go from talking every day to talking every few weeks, and then forget about each other’s existence. https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/masha-gessen/

* matters more as civics and family decline
> Yet it’s precisely because of the atomized, customized nature of our lives that we rely on our friends so very much. We are recruiting them into the roles of people who once simply coexisted with us—parents, aunts and uncles, cousins, fellow parishioners, fellow union members, fellow Rotarians. It’s not wholly natural, this business of making our own tribes.
* traits of friendship
> People tend to stand up for each other in each other’s absence; trust and confide in each other; support each other emotionally; offer help if it’s required; try to make each other happy; and keep each other up-to-date on positive life developments.
* you need to stay in touch in a personal way
> It’s that last one where I’m always falling down. Keeping up contact, ideally embodied contact, though even semi-embodied contact—by voice, over the phone—would probably suffice. Only when reading Elisa and Rebecca in atom-splitting meltdown did I realize just how crucial this habit is. The two women had become theoretical to each other, the sum only of their ideas; their friendship had migrated almost exclusively to the page. “The writing took the place of our real-life relationship,” Elisa told me. “I felt like the writing was the friendship.”
* ritual
> The problem is that when it comes to friendship, we are ritual-deficient, nearly devoid of rites that force us together...Friendship anniversaries. Regular road trips. Sunday-night phone calls, annual gatherings at the same rental house, whatever it takes...When I consider the people I know with the greatest talent for friendship, I realize that they do just this. They make contact a priority. They jump in their cars. They appear at regular intervals in my inbox. One told me she clicks open her address book every now and then just to check which friends she hasn’t seen in a while—and then immediately makes a date to get together.

> On June 22 [2020], the Trump administration issued an executive order suspending many foreign work visas at least until the end of this year. The order included the J-1 visa program, under which the au pair program, managed by the State Department, is categorized.
> Though administered by the State Department, the au pair program is operated by a network of private agencies (Cultural Care, Au Pair Care and Au Pair in America are a few big ones) that are in charge of vetting and matching au pairs with host families before they even set foot in the United States. On the ground, au pairs and host families deal more directly with local child care consultants, or L.C.C.s — regional counselors for the agencies who oversee day-to-day issues that arise in households. If an in-country au pair wants to rematch, or switch families later on, her request must first be approved by the L.C.C. and the match ultimately approved by the agency. But many introductory conversations are often carried out via unofficial channels — Facebook, WhatsApp and personal referrals between au pairs and families — to streamline the process. In recent weeks, these unofficial networks have become inundated. Many in-country au pairs are now telling interested hosts that they are only willing to match in exchange for certain assurances, such as a personal car or payment upward of $400 a week. The minimum stipend for au pairs is $195.75 a week for a maximum of 45 hours of work, which is set by the State Department.
> Enrollment for American host families is more straightforward: Between agency program fees and required au pair expenses (such as weekly stipends, travel and food, and up to $500 toward a mandatory education requirement), the total minimum cost of the program is around $20,000 a year, regardless of the number of children in the family. If a family pays only the minimum, it’s affordable when compared with traditional child care options.
> When the match is a good one, families and au pairs can come away with long-lasting relationships. “Child care is one aspect of it, but we’ve really appreciated the cultural exchange component,” said Dawn Gile, a lawyer and host mom in Maryland. “We were going to travel to Europe to go visit our former au pairs. We keep in touch with them, our girls had this exposure to foreign languages, culture, food — they’ve been so enriched by the au pair program.”

In your book you have lots of great stories about how you influenced your kids, and I believe you did for a while, but what the adoption and twin evidence says is that the feeling that parents are changing their kids is based on an illusion. There is a big short-run effect, but the long-run effect is very different.

> But part of the Gottman legend is that the old school of marriage therapists kind of missed that part. They were really into solving conflicts and having good communication skills and things like that. But over his years of monitoring hundreds of couples in real-world situations, Gottman found that this was overrated. Plenty of couples had atrocious communication skills and got in conflicts all the time, but loved each other very much and had no real marital problems. Plenty of other couples had finely-polished communication skills and always used “I statements” and things like that, and still ended up divorced. Communication skills are good, and you should definitely try to have them, but you’re putting the cart before the horse unless you focus on liking your spouse.

> I think the analogy works on one level but not another. I’d argue that the definition of religion has two key pieces, and both are necessary to consider. First, religions are of course distinguished by what Lyons calls “a series of what are ultimately metaphysical beliefs.” But the second part of the definition, and the one Lyons ignores, is that religions are distinguished from other belief systems by their proven ability to survive across generations under a wide variety of conditions. https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/is-wokeness-a-paper-tiger

* _Buddhism popular now b/c_: lack of anthropomorphic deity, invitation to critical reasoning, lack of confessional or ritual demands, historical toleration of other beliefs
* _less popular aspects of Buddhism in West_: belief in miracles, otherworldly realms, traditional gender roles; Buddhism largely geared towards needs of agricultural peasant adherents until only 50-100 years ago
> Stoicism and Buddhism have become odd bedfellows as belief systems for the unchurched. For Buddhism, its religious elements are ignored (eschatology, political role, laity/monks distinction) and for Stoicism its metaphysics (Farnsworth acknowledges his own disinterest in the topic). - email to Cowen, 20.09.18
> The difference between “religion” and “culture” has always been pretty vague. Shinto is the best example; it’s less a coherent metaphysical narrative than a bunch of things Japanese people do and a repository for Japanese traditions and rituals. A quick look at Hinduism reveals that they have no idea what gods they believe in, it’s a bunch of different religions stuck together under one umbrella, but the point is that it’s the sort of thing Indian people do and a repository of Indian traditions. Even though Jews have a pretty coherent religion, the line between “Jewish culture” and “Jewish religion” is equally fuzzy. Religion as distinct from culture seems like a pretty Western phenomenon, the result of a triumphant Christianity colonizing cultures it never originated from, ending out with the modern conception of culture as ethnic food + silly costumes. https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/25/is-everything-a-religion/

* people want to believe but can't
> Many highly educated people who hover on the doorway of a church or synagogue are like my Augustine-reading friend. They relate to religion on a communal or philosophical level. They want to pass on a clear ethical inheritance to their children. They find certain God-haunted writers interesting or inspiring, and the biblical cadences of the civil rights era more moving than secular defenses of equality or liberty. Yet they struggle to make the leap of faith, to reach a state where the supernatural parts become believable and the grace to accept the impossible is bestowed.
* intent
> the idea that the universe was created with intent, intelligence and even love explained why the world in which you found yourself had the appearance of a created thing...vivid and beautiful and awesome in a way that resembles and yet exceeds the human capacity for art
* Godliness
> the idea that human beings are fashioned, in some way, in the image of the universe’s creator...an embodied creature with an animal form, and yet your consciousness also seemed to stand outside it
* supernatural
> signs of a higher order of reality...feelings of oneness and universal love to strange happenings at the threshold of death to encounters with beings that human beings might label (gods and demons, ghosts and faeries) but never fully understand
* our world is stil enchanted
> Now consider the possibility that in our own allegedly disenchanted era, after Galileo, Copernicus, Darwin, Einstein - all of this is still true...I Similarly, when today’s evolutionary theorists go searching for a reason people believe so readily in spiritual powers and nonhuman minds, they are also making a concession to religion’s plausibility — because most of our evolved impulses and appetites correspond directly to something in reality itself.
* evolutionary
> Similarly, when today's evolutionary theorists go searching for a reason people believe so readily in spiritual powers and nonhuman minds, they are also making a concession to religion’s plausibility - because most of our evolved impulses and appetites correspond directly to something in reality itself. Of course, religion could be the exception: a desire with no real object, a set of experiences with no correlate outside the mind
* near-death
> Take, as just one example, the case of near-death experiences, which were a culturally submerged phenomenon until Raymond A. Moody started compiling testimony in the late 1960s. After decades of research, we know such experiences are commonplace and surprisingly consistent in certain features...just conceding their persistent existence is noteworthy, given how easy it is to imagine a world where these kinds of experiences didn’t happen, where nobody came back from the threshold of death with a life-changing account of light suffused with love or where the experiences of the dying were just a random dreamlike jumble. In such a world that absence would be a pretty telling point against religion: You say we should expect some sort of spiritual survival after death, but people who come close to the doorway just see Livia Soprano's "big nothing."
* faith to religion
> Postulating an uncreated divine intelligence or ultimate reality doesn’t tell us much about what God wants from us. Presupposing an active spiritual realm doesn't prove that we should all go back to church, especially if these experiences show up cross-culturally, which means they don’t confirm any specific dogma.

It’s a broadside against Moralistic Therapeutic Deism, and the way every institution in our culture - including many churches and families - think of God ("as some kind of divine therapist...a psychiatrist who treats each of his patients the same way, a friend whom we can call in times of need"). "Why change your life for such a God?" Lehner asks. "He makes no demands." https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/the-curse-of-identity-politics/

> John Gray, whom I love as an author, has this great book called Seven Types of Atheism. And he agrees as you just did that a society without a religion just doesn't have a lot of binding glue. He himself is also one of these brainy philosophical types, and at the end, he just can't bring himself to believe. So what do you do? You show up on Sundays and sing along. Because ultimately, religion is also a social activity. https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/niall-ferguson-on-the-gods-of-history

> I agree with Michel Houellebecq (certainly not a religious believer himself) but he’s a devoté of Auguste Comte, who said that he himself was an atheist but societies have to have religion. You have to have this thing that binds you together in the moment as a society, but also binds you to something transcendent.
> You can’t force yourself to just practice Christianity and not believe in Christ. It’s a very difficult thing to do. Very brainy, educated people who are raised in secular modernity like Niall Ferguson (I’m putting words in his mouth, but I’m paraphrasing his interview) find it very difficult to believe just because they have to as members of a society. John Gray wrote a book called Seven Types of Atheism, and he’s also a brainy, philosophical sort who concedes that we need religion, but he can’t bring himself to believe. That’s the big issue with Christianity in modernity: It’s such a deeply-felt personal thing that skews more to the orthodoxic than orthopraxic side of things, it’s difficult to entertain as mere social practice. Do you agree that Western society needs some sort of animating religion? And if so, given that it’s Christianity in play, what is to be done here?

> People in richer and more educated nations see themselves as higher status. And the higher that people see themselves, the less willing they are to bow down to others. Culture has eliminated most of the ways that people once had to defer and bow to elites around them... Some see the key dynamic here as people slowly learning over time the fact that there are no gods. But why should a nation have to get rich itself to learn this fact, if other nations around it have already learned it?

Douthat on secularism
* individualistic
> the American educated class is deeply committed to a moral vision that regards emancipated, self-directed choice as essential to human freedom and the good life. The tension between this worldview and the thou-shalt-not, death-of-self commandments of biblical religion can be bridged only with difficulty — especially because the American emphasis on authenticity makes it hard for people to simply live with certain hypocrisies and self-contradictions, or embrace a church that judges their self-affirming choices on any level, however distant or abstract.
* materialist
> they have all been trained in a kind of scientism, which regards strong religious belief as fundamentally anti-rational, miracles as superstition, the idea of a personal God as so much wishful thinking. Thus when spiritual ideas creep back into elite culture, it’s often in the form of “wellness” or self-help disciplines, or in enthusiasms like astrology, where there’s always a certain deniability about whether you’re really invoking a spiritual reality, really committing to metaphysical belief.
> if they feel drawn by a desire for community or moral formation to experiment with churchgoing...then their materialist bias makes it hard for them to persevere, to get up early to perform rituals or recite creeds whose claims they can’t actually believe.
* it would be rational to be less materialist
> But I am more puzzled by secular-minded people who think the rationality of religion has, under modern conditions, somehow been disproved. Yes, science has undercut some religious ideas once held with certainty. But our supposedly “disenchanted” world remains the kind of world that inspired religious belief in the first place: a miraculously ordered and lawbound system that generates conscious beings who can mysteriously unlock its secrets, who display godlike powers in miniature and also a strong demonic streak, and whose lives are constantly buffeted by hard-to-explain encounters and intimations of transcendence. To be dropped into such a world and not be persistently open to religious possibilities seems much more like prejudice than rationality.

But if it was really literally true — this is a new religion where people are going to get together once a week, and they’re going to know each other, and they’re going to have a higher value system that motivates them, and they’re going to make connections — that would be really good.

> Even setting aside the geography of the country, there is no instance I’m aware of in which a country or region with a total fertility rate below replacement has fought a serious insurgency. Once you’re the kind of people who can’t inconvenience yourselves enough to have kids, you are not going to risk your lives for a political ideal. When the US invaded Afghanistan and Iraq, their total fertility rates were 7.4 and 4.7, respectively...Ukraine is at 1.2. We see numbers like this and don’t stop to appreciate the wide chasm that separates the spiritual lives of nations where the average person has 1 kid from those with 3 or more, much less 6 or 7, each. On fertility, Russia isn’t that much better than Ukraine, but it’s got the tanks and a powerful air force, and the side that wants to fight a guerrilla war has to be the one that is willing to take a much larger number of casualties. There’s a consistent pattern of history where there’s a connection between making life and being willing to sacrifice it. This, by the way, is also why Hong Kong was easily pacified when China started clamping down, and why Taiwan will fold and not fight an insurgency if it ever comes down to it. https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/russia-as-the-great-satan-in-the

> I think point is true more generally. Most of the people profiled in the articles above are well-off, educated Americans. I think it’s important to remember that well-off, educated Americans are in the top 1% of people today in terms of how good their children’s lives are likely to be, and probably in the top 0.01% throughout history. Five hundred years ago, an average child had about a 40% chance of dying of some terrible disease before they were five years old. If they survived, they would be chattel property of some lord who would make them do backbreaking farm labor their entire lives without any hope of earning more than subsistence wages. If female, she could be married off against her will to some random man 10-20 years older than she was, with the legal right to rape her as much as he wanted. If male, he might be drafted to serve as a literal pawn in some border war, and die of dysentery on the way to being bayonetted by some enemy. If gay, they could be burned alive; if black, enslaved; if poor, left to starve. Much of the world is still pretty similar to this! Meanwhile, your child is likely to live in a stable home, get spoiled and bought a thousand different kinds of toys, go to a good college, and make well above median US income. Even quite a lot of global warming-related suffering doesn’t take them out of the luckiest 1% of people in history. If you think privileged modern Americans shouldn’t have children now because of quality-of-life issues, you implicitly believe that nobody in the Third World, or nobody before 1900, should ever have had children. This isn’t necessarily wrong. There’s a group of philosophers called "antinatalists" who believe nobody should ever have kids because life is suffering. These people are at least consistent. If you’re not one of them, I think the quality-of-life argument for not having kids now is pretty weak. https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/please-dont-give-up-on-having-kids https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-kids
> Overall I agree with Lyman that maybe Orban has boosted the fertility rate by 0.1 - 0.2 children per women, certainly no more. And this is by bringing out all the stops - transforming the entire culture and spending heaps of money on the project. I’m not sure this really provides some kind of exciting proof that conservative policies work, even if you’re only looking at the fertility rate. But take away the family planning, and it’s hard to see what you can admire about Orban’s regime, other than the brute fact that it’s conservative and still standing. “If conservatives rig elections, they can stay in power.” Probably true, but seems kind of obvious, and hardly worth building a political philosophy around.

> Like other scholars, many scientists have never directly earned a living — never, that is, been paid in return for services rendered. Most scholars live in an anomalous microworld in which money is something doled out by committees instead of a representation for work, and it seems natural to them that national economies should be run along the same lines. As a result, many otherwise intelligent people were socialists in the middle of the twentieth century. http://www.paulgraham.com/saynotes.html

By the eve of the Civil War they were the only "politically correct" things a politician from the Deep South could say about slavery...The point I would like to make here is a bit more basic. The American south of 1860 was more racist, more despotic, and less tolerant of traditional Americans liberties like freedom of speech than was the American south 1790. https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2015/06/there-is-no-right-side-of-history.html

> American thought has always tended to a certain solipsism, a trait that has become more prominent in recent times. If Fukuyama and his neoconservative allies believed the world was yearning to be remade on an imaginary American model, the woke movement believes "whiteness" accounts for all the evils of modern societies. America’s record of slavery and racism is all too real. Even so, passing over in silence the repression and enslavement of peoples outside the West – Tibetans, Uighurs and now Mongols in China, for example – because they cannot be condemned as crimes of white supremacy reveals a wilfully parochial and self-absorbed outlook. - John Gray https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2020/10/american-unreality

> Wedded to this cynical vision of the current arrangements is an equally cynical take on the history of America's imposed order. Beijing is well aware that if it decided to do to Tonga now what the United States did to Hawaii more than a century ago it would mean war. At the time the United States suffered nothing of the sort. Not that American wars were without their own rewards—the Americans claim island bases like Guam and Saipan as prizes won through conquest. China is not allowed to conquer its own prizes. It cannot fight wars to give its forces a new ports and bases; it is not even allowed build little artificial islands for the purpose. Never mind that all of that strikes the Chinese's ire happened generations ago. Anything this side of the Taiping is modern history for the Chinese. American attempts to deny that, to claim that the world should work differently now than it did when the American star first began to rise, simply prove that morality and sweet sounding words like ‘international norms’ are for the winners. All of that talk about being a responsible stakeholder is just a nicer way to say we plan on kicking down the ladder now that we have finished climbing up it. https://scholars-stage.org/china-does-not-want-your-rules-based-order/

> Survival turns on a few split second decisions, and if these decisions had to be continually made (as would be the case in the Hollywood style of battle) the warrior in question would die sooner than later, even if he was a far better fighter than average. Fighting this way is suicidal. No army could tolerate doing it.
> the central purpose of fighting in formation was to make warfare tolerable
* land vs. sea https://scholars-stage.org/fear-the-logic-of-the-first-strike/
> War on land often revolves around maneuver and position. There is high ground and low, choke points and gaps, terrain difficult to move across, easy to hide in, or possible to fortify. In this environment the most successful tacticians are usually those who can identify weak points and exercise the energy needed to exploit them.
> In naval combat there are no weak points—or rather, ships are nothing but weak points. Neptune is an unforgiving master: the ocean offers nowhere to hide and no way to fortify. With a few littoral features excepted, naval combat takes place on a featureless sea. One does not flank a fleet. “Forces at sea are not broken by encirclement; they are broken by destruction.”
> I wonder if we properly appreciate how the inherent strength of the defense contributed to strategic stability during the Cold War. It mattered that most of the major crisis points—the DMZ separating North from South, the Fulda Gap funneling tanks East to West—were heavily fortified bits of land. 
> I worry that politicians and military planners in Washington, Beijing, and Tokyo do not fully realize that what was true in Western Europe in the Cold War is not true in the Western Pacific. Battle at sea does not favor the defender. Naval tactics reward the side that hits first and hits fast. In 21st century conditions, war by missile and air raid follow a similar logic: weapons systems are too frail and too centralized to guarantee a secure second strike. 
> Japanese commanders did not attack Pearl Harbor because the ships there were undefended, but because they thought that attacking from peace guaranteed they knew the location of their pray. Pearl Harbor was the natural culmination of the tactical maxim “attack effectively first.” That these tactical realities helped push Imperial Japan into such a terrific strategic blunder should give us pause. It is an unsettling precedent for the for the next round of great power competition over the Pacific.

> A young Zoomer just come of age is four generations removed from serious social violence. They never learned about leftist bombings, Texas border lynchings, Mormon extermination, or electoral street brawls, and have never experienced anything like them. Events like these have faded from our national memory. They faded so quickly because even in their own day such small atrocities seemed like a background hum to the larger national narrative. Familiarity with violence bred "a confidence that almost any kind of mess could be brought under control quickly enough" notes one historian, "and that if a few people died in the meantime, that was just the way of the world." https://scholars-stage.org/on-sparks-before-the-prairie-fire/
* robots = constant low-level violence
> The world may yet explode into another WW2-style conflagration, or the kind of nuclear holocaust we feared during the Cold War. If so, then my bet is that drones will dominate that battlefield. But most of the modern military technologies led themselves to a very different kind of great-power war — a war of constant sniping and harassment. Assassin drones, cyberattacks, info ops, and bioweapons raise the possibility of never-ending low-grade attacks that are below the threshold of massive retaliation. https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-future-of-war-is-bizarre-and
